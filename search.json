    "text": "2 The Early Universe: From Symmetry Breaking to Hadronization\nSo we are living in a universe made of hadronic physics, but it was not always the case.\nI like thinking of the evolution of the universe on a time scale, with the origin of the universe where everything started. There was a Big Bang first, and then several epochs followed. It started with the Planck epoch, then there was the electroweak epoch, and then the quark epoch.\n\n2.0.1 The Electroweak Epoch and Symmetry Breaking\nWhat has been happening during these epochs is the part of the physics that we go through in the courses.\nLet me start with the electroweak epoch. This is where the Higgs potential V(\\phi) = \\mu^2 |\\phi|^2 + \\lambda |\\phi|^4\n—that is the field giving masses to particles and making sure that our proton doesn’t decay and our life can exist—gets a condensate.\nThe electroweak phase is where the transition happens. The entire space is filled now with a condensate, a fixed, non-moving condensate of the Higgs field, through which particles are slowed down; they get inertia and they obtain mass. That’s something known as the Higgs mechanism.\nThis process of the potential evolving is called spontaneous symmetry breaking, when one of the minima is picked. That’s how I like thinking about the electroweak stage.\nSo what happens then? Particles have masses. The universe starts evolving, and at some point we arrive at the quark epoch.\n\n\n2.0.2 The Quark Epoch and Quark-Gluon Plasma\nAt this stage, the universe is filled with a quark-gluon plasma. Essentially, quarks and gluons are making an unstructured soup of objects. There is nothing about structure formation yet. This is rather quarks disturbing—there is no yet scale that we are going to talk about.\nQuarks and gluons are together, and the universe is extremely hot. From that moment it starts cooling down. At some point the temperature is low enough that this medium starts separating, and we arrive at the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) epoch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe transition to a quark-gluon plasma occurs when the temperature exceeds the QCD scale: T_{\\text{QGP}} \\sim \\Lambda_{\\text{QCD}} \\approx 150 \\text{–} 200 \\text{ MeV} . In the early universe, the age during this epoch can be estimated as t \\sim M_{\\text{Pl}} / T^2 , which for T \\sim 150 \\text{ MeV} gives t \\sim 10^{-6} \\text{ s} .\n\n\n\nThis hot medium starts forming small volumes where the interactions of quarks and gluons are confined to a small scale. You need two years to learn this in detail. This comes in particle physics, introductory nuclear physics, and a specialized course on QCD at finite temperature, since it’s a heated medium and there are different laws applied.\n\n\n2.0.3 The Hadronic Universe and Confinement\nHadrons are what we are going to focus on now. But if you think of how quickly this all happened, you’re going to be slightly surprised.\nThe timeline is incredibly brief:\n\n10^{-36} seconds for the Planck epoch\n10^{-12} seconds for the electroweak epoch\n10^{-6} seconds for the QCD transition\nThen 1 second.\n\nJust imagine there was nothing, and then the sound reached you on the back. When I clap, if you look at my palms, the time span between when I close them and you hear the sound is roughly 10 milliseconds. By that time we had already passed through all the stages and everything hadronized. That’s how quickly the universe evolved.\nIn that scale, the rest of the interval to the 13 billion years—the age of our universe—has been other interesting physics, but not as intense as this from the perspective of our hadron physics.\nWe can be talking about hadrons in the sense that we will be talking about the strong interaction. The hadrons are objects where the strong interactions are confined to the small scale of a few fermi: R_{\\text{hadron}} \\sim 1 / \\Lambda_{\\text{QCD}} \\approx 1 \\text{ fm} = 10^{-15} \\text{ m}.\nThere is essentially nothing around. There is a small chunk of volume where the quarks and gluons live. They interact with each other. There are large fractions of empty space.\nOne fermi is 10^{-15} meters. It’s difficult to imagine this scale, but this number can help you. It is a smaller scale we have, and the smallest scale where we actually can separate things.\nThe strong interaction is confined in this small scale and it stays there. By colliding hadrons we learned how to study internal structure and how to separate the subject. But there is no natural scale smaller than that."

    "section": "3 The Emptiness of Matter and the Color Charge",
    "text": "3 The Emptiness of Matter and the Color Charge\nSo concerning the empty space in an atom, I wanted to sketch one of the most common elements on Earth. From the periodic table, what is the most common element? I think it’s oxygen.\nA neutral oxygen atom has eight protons and eight neutrons. Oxygen has many isotopes; one common one is oxygen-16, while oxygen-18 has eight protons and ten neutrons. The atom is neutral, so there must be electrons compensating the charge of the protons. The protons give a charge of +8e , and there are eight electrons in the configuration 1s^2 2s^2 2p^4 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis notation, 1s^2 2s^2 2p^4 , is the ground-state electron configuration for a neutral oxygen atom (atomic number Z = 8 ). It describes how its 8 electrons are distributed: 2 in the 1s orbital, 2 in the 2s orbital, and 4 in the 2p orbitals.\n\n\n\nThe atom’s electrical neutrality is expressed by the condition q_{\\text{atom}} = Z e + (-e) \\sum_{i=1}^{Z} 1 = 0 . For oxygen ( Z=8 ), this is +8e - 8e = 0 .\nTo understand the scale of emptiness, let’s look at the nucleus. There is a center where protons and neutrons are packed closely together. Knowing the scale of a hadron, you can guess the core’s scale. The size of the nucleus scales as:\nR = R_0 A^{1/3}\nHere, R_0 \\approx 1.2 \\, \\text{fm} (femtometers) is a constant, and A is the mass number (protons + neutrons). This nuclear radius formula arises because nuclear volume is proportional to A , assuming nucleons are closely packed with nearly constant density. For oxygen-16 ( A = 16 ), the nuclear radius is roughly R \\approx 1.2 \\times 16^{1/3} \\, \\text{fm} \\approx 3 \\, \\text{fm} .\nBut electrons are completely different. Their wave function has a size about 3 orders of magnitude bigger. The atomic radius is roughly 50 picometers ( 5 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m} ).\nNow consider this scale difference:\n\\frac{R_{\\text{atom}}}{R_{\\text{nucleus}}} \\approx \\frac{50 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\text{m}}{3 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}} \\sim 10^4\nThis atomic vs. nuclear scale ratio—about 10,000—shows how empty an atom is. There is a very small core, and around it is a vast space where the electrons exist. In that space, there is no strong interaction.\nThe second item is what we know as the fundamental hardware: the Standard Model. This is the theory in particle physics that describes most known interactions. Setting aside neutrinos—where there are open questions—it describes everything well.\nThe part responsible for strong interactions is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The participants are quarks and gluons. These are the only particles in the Standard Model that carry color charge, which is the charge needed to interact via the strong force.\nThis is similar to electrodynamics: only objects that are not neutral can interact. However, in strong interactions, the relevant charge is a different type—it’s not electric charge, it’s color charge. We could have invented a different word, but “color charge” is the term.\nThink of this charge as analogous to the electric charge of an electron or muon. But it’s a different quantum number; they are independent. This is the charge independence principle in the Standard Model:\nQ_{\\text{em}} \\neq Q_{\\text{color}}\n\nA particle with electric charge does not have to have color charge (e.g., an electron).\nA particle with color charge does not have to have electric charge (e.g., a gluon).\n\nWe usually measure electric charge in elementary units: the electron is -1 , the positron is +1 . For color charge, we don’t use simple units. Instead, we describe quarks and gluons by introducing their color wave function. Once they have a non-trivial color wave function, they are color-charged."

    "section": "4 The Origin of Mass and the Constituent Quark Model",
    "text": "4 The Origin of Mass and the Constituent Quark Model\nTo finish with the Standard Model, I want to mention that these are the only particles that have color charge.\nLet me list other particles of the Standard Model: the electron and muon. The electron, muon, and tau lepton are kind of the same, but they have different masses. The electron is the one that is orbiting or living and compensating the charge of protons and neutrons in the nuclei. The muon is the heavier brother of the electron. The tau is a much heavier sister of the electron. All of them can be in both configurations.\nBut let’s complete the list. What else is in the Standard Model? Photons and neutrinos. That’s all. I just draw them all here to say that they don’t have color charge. They don’t have color charge, so they don’t interact with the quarks and are not influenced by the strong force. We will see them all the time, but they don’t participate in the strong interaction.\nAs I mentioned, if you don’t have a color charge, you don’t interact strongly. But if you have a color charge, you must interact strongly, though it doesn’t mean you don’t interact in other ways. All of these particles have different quantum numbers. Essentially, they are electrically charged. The electric charge of protons and neutrons is not zero for quarks.\nThere are six quarks in the Standard Model. That’s what we see: six quarks exist. They are different, but they have common properties. They are separated into groups by their electric charge.\n\nThose in the upper row have a positive charge of Q = +\\frac{2}{3}e .\nThe lower row has an electric charge of Q = -\\frac{1}{3}e .\n\nThey also split on the horizontal axis into three groups. These are generations: the first generation, second generation, and third generation. The higher the generation you go, the more difficult the particles are to produce, as the objects become heavier. This is why most of the matter we see around us is made of the first generation.\nWe produce strangeness rather easily once we collide particles. Cosmic rays have a lot of strange particle production, and less of the charm quark. The ‘C’ stands for charm. However, it also appears in cosmic rays. There is actually a hot discussion these days on whether the strange quark and the interaction of strange quarks is relevant for the equation of state when stars evolve.\nWe want to describe the maximal size of a neutron star. This maximal size is driven by the equation of state. Essentially, it depends on how the atoms are packed inside the neutron star. If there are clusters where strange particles appear, it changes the equation of state. This then changes the observable characteristics. Over the last five years, more discussion has evolved on the equation of state and the relevance of the strange quark there.\nThe charm quark is mostly studied in collisions at high energy, because you need a lot of energy to produce charm and bottom quarks. The top quark is relevant for Higgs physics. That’s the domain where these two are studied. The up and down quarks are called light quarks. The strange quark, charm quark, and bottom quark are studied a lot in colliders to see CP violation and in the search for precision physics.\nThe top quark measures very well the Standard Model quantities related to Higgs physics and electroweak interactions. We’ll be focusing on the five lighter flavors and will not talk much about the top quark because its lifetime is so short that it decays before it can form hadrons. You won’t find any hadrons that contain a top quark. But all of these other quarks can form hadrons.\nMost of the matter we know and that is abundantly present is of two types. We are going to talk about pions.\nWelcome to a lecture dedicated to the constituent quark model. Here is a sketch of the simple pictures that classify hadrons. As you see, there are two types: mesons and baryons. This model describes hadrons as compositions of a quark-antiquark pair or three quarks.\nYou may ask about gluons. I would like to come back to this picture. There is something very beautiful happening around the chiral symmetry breaking scale. Essentially, another condensation process occurs. When hadronization happens, as quarks and gluons from the soup start to confine themselves, the gluon field condenses as well.\nWhat happens is that the gluon field, similar to the Higgs field, forms a medium in which the quarks are moving. This medium is colored, and the quarks, by interacting with it, acquire energy. Effectively, gluons are now dressing the quarks, making them massive. The quarks we draw in the constituent picture are different from the Standard Model quarks; they are quarks dressed by gluons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the constituent quark model, quarks are dressed by gluons and acquire effective masses much larger than their bare masses. For light quarks: m_u^{\\text{const}} \\approx m_d^{\\text{const}} \\approx \\frac{m_p}{3} \\approx 313 \\text{ MeV}\nThis is compared to their bare masses from the Higgs mechanism, which are m_u^{\\text{bare}} \\approx m_d^{\\text{bare}} \\sim 3 \\text{ MeV} .\n\n\n\nThere is a nice way of thinking about this. Look at the masses of the light quarks. The mass of the u quark and d quark is on the order of 3 \\text{ MeV} . We will be using natural units throughout the course, where the speed of light c = 1 and \\hbar = 1 .\nIf you look at the other way of expressing \\hbar , it is a quantity with units: \\hbar = 6.6 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s} , which is also equal to 6.6 \\times 10^{-22} \\text{ MeV} \\cdot \\text{s} . In natural units, we set \\hbar = 1 . This immediately tells you that to achieve that, you need to be able to translate meters to seconds.\nFrom that, you can take this second and move it to the other side: 1 \\text{ s} = 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m} . Meters are the same as seconds. Also from that, you can realize that in these units, 1 \\text{ s}^{-1} = 6.6 \\times 10^{-22} \\text{ MeV} . You can also relate joule and second. It’s important to realize these are not just relations between numbers, but also units.\nThis is the way you translate any meters to seconds and any second to mega electron volts. That’s the way to translate electron volts to seconds, and also the way to translate kilograms, because a joule can be expressed in kilograms. In these natural units, \\text{MeV} is the unit of mass, energy, and inverse distance. We will be using eV, MeV, and GeV for everything.\nJust to have a scale, in kilograms it’s 10^{-30} , which is a huge number. But what is the mass of the proton? The proton, which in the constituent model is made of u and d quarks, has a mass of roughly 1 \\text{ GeV} . To be accurate, the proton mass is around 1.67 \\times 10^{-27} \\text{ kg} .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The diagram shows the contribution of different components to the visible mass of matter. Only about one percent comes from the Higgs field, which provides intrinsic fermion masses through Yukawa couplings, while the remaining ninety-nine percent arises from gluon interactions inside nucleons, where the QCD binding energy and quantum fluctuations generate the bulk of the nucleon mass.\n\n\n\nLet’s do a comparison. The Higgs mechanism involves making the condensate that gives all particles their masses. The mass that quarks get from the Higgs is a few MeV. Then another phenomenon happens. Essentially, energy gets stored in the strong quark interaction.\nAt the place where the strong interaction is happening, there is a large energy density of the gluon condensate. This large energy accounts for about 99% of the proton mass. If you think of the origin of mass, which was discussed a lot when the Higgs was discovered, the Higgs explains only a small part. It is less than 1% of the proton mass.\nI calculated the total mass. I summed the three quark masses and divided by three as well. It’s about 1%. If you think like I am around 70 kilos, what are these 70 kilos? Is it me moving through the Higgs field? It is actually gluons and quarks held together by the strong interaction. So, 69 point something kilos of me is due to strong gluon interactions."

    "section": "5 Foundations of Quantum Field Theory",
    "text": "5 Foundations of Quantum Field Theory\nNow let’s move to a bit more of the equations and discuss quantum dynamics. Quantum chromodynamics is the theory of strong interactions. Quantum electrodynamics is the theory of electromagnetic interactions. I will put both of them because there is a lot in common between these two.\nI think I wrote this already. The framework that we use, starting from classical mechanics, and it turned out to be the most successful, is the Lagrangian approach. Similar to a mechanical system, in order to describe the quantum system, we will be using the Lagrangian and Lagrange equations.\nLet me start with QED. So what is QED? QED essentially is the electromagnetic field. If someone asks you about equations in QED, the first thing that comes to mind is the Maxwell equations. This is the equation of motion for the electric field.\nThe index \\mu here indicates that it’s a vector field. It means under boosts and rotations, it transforms as a vector. As the vector that we are used to, like the particle is moving in certain directions, its momentum is also a vector. The same thing is for this field.\nOnce you see the \\mu index, you know how to boost and rotate this object because it belongs to the vector representation of the Lorentz group. If someone asks you, “I give you the vector,” the zero component is the time component of the four-vector, and then the vector component. It’s the same as the regular four-vectors for momentum: the zero component is the energy and then the spatial components are the momentum. The same for the vector field.\nAgain, you see the index \\mu and then you know what it is. If I give you a four-vector for the vector field and ask you how it looks if I rotate it by 90 degrees, you know what to do. You remember the rotation matrix: 1, 0, cosine, sine. You just apply this to the vector and that’s it. You know how to boost this field as well, because it’s a vector field. There is a gamma, beta, gamma matrix that you apply and then you have it.\nThis might sound familiar already. This was in quantum mechanics and many other courses. They will be extremely useful in other field theory courses. But in our course we’ll be mostly operating with a different way. We barely will be using the four-vector. We barely will be using this, essentially four-vectors and tensor contractions.\nAnother thing to note is that here I am explicitly using Einstein notation and explicitly summing over repeated indices. \\mu here, \\mu there. They are repeated. That means if I were accurate, I should have written here a sum, and then have A_\\mu from 0 to 3, and sum all of the components. The \\nu is a repeated index again, sum.\nIf I look at this, how many terms should I sum? If I put a sum here, how many terms component-wise? If I expand this, how long will it be? It’s a 4 times 4, right? It’s 16 terms. If I also put F_{\\mu\\nu} here, and then have these two fields, for both of them there will be an extra four because it’s a two here, two there. If you multiply them, they will be 16 times 4, which is 64 terms.\nThe equation of motion for this Lagrangian is obtained using the Lagrange equation. You might remember this from classical mechanics where we had dots and the first one was the time derivative, the second one was the derivative of the field. We treat our Lagrangian as a function of the fields and their derivatives.\nWe feel the derivatives and the fields as the different objects and we first differentiate by the derivatives and second we differentiate by the field variables. In that case X is a \\mu . There should be a sum over \\mu . And then the X is the A_\\rho . It’s another Lorentz index.\nIf I take this Lagrangian and I use the Lagrange equation, I get the equation of motion, how the field is moving through space. We know that it’s Maxwell equations. So the equation of motion gives Maxwell and that is important.\nNow let me introduce the second part of the topic. This was the gauge field. It’s called A_\\mu . This is a little bit less intuitive concept that you might have seen before. But we will need it as well so that there are degrees of freedom that are not fixed for the photons, for the electromagnetic field.\nThere is an arbitrary gauge that we fix, that we can explore. This gauge is manifested in the fact that we can take A_\\mu and move it to other A'_\\mu which is A_\\mu - \\partial_\\mu \\chi . So \\chi is a scalar field. Essentially I’m taking all of my fields and I shift them by a derivative.\nUnder this transformation, F_{\\mu\\nu} goes to F'_{\\mu\\nu} . In order to find what it goes to, we have to put it here. This A becomes A' and then you have derivatives. Since this is a function of the space coordinate, you have to differentiate this term as well. You have to do this for the second term.\nIt turns out, and it’s easy to see, that the minus sign kills the extra term. So F'_{\\mu\\nu} = F_{\\mu\\nu} . Then our Lagrangian is invariant. This is the symmetry of the Lagrangian under gauge transformation.\nIf you do the exercise of the variation of the Lagrangian equations and the Maxwell Lagrangian trying to get the Maxwell equations, you won’t get immediately the known Maxwell equations, you will get them up to a gauge. So we see what this derivative does. It picks one of the terms.\nIf you differentiate F_{\\mu\\nu} by the derivative, you will get \\partial_\\rho A_\\nu - \\partial_\\nu A_\\rho and then it will be left over. Maxwell equation, as we know, is \\partial_\\mu \\partial^\\mu A_\\nu = 0 . But you will get an extra term that is easy to kill.\nIf you know that gauge invariance is present and in order to argue that this extra term vanishes, you can say that I can choose in all of my space such a function \\chi that kills the extra term. By fixing the gauge this way you get the common Maxwell equations that we have in electromagnetics.\nFine, we now introduce the fermion fields. As we do in electrodynamics, we have our leptons and the \\psi , where the \\bar{\\psi} is \\psi^\\dagger \\gamma^0 . Actually the \\psi is the four-component spinor which is built by steering degrees.\nEvery Lagrangian is a scalar quantity. It means there are no indices. It’s not a vector, not a matrix. Every Lagrangian is sort of a function, a number, and it’s made of objects of different dimensionality. The fermion field, a fermion is a particle that has spin one half.\nSince we have to deal with the particle and antiparticle components in the same vector, we have four components in the bispinor here. These are these four components. Don’t mix them up with a four-vector. It’s not legal to say \\mu because \\mu would indicate that this is an object that transforms under boosts and rotations the same way as the four-momentum. But that’s not true.\nThis field transforms differently. It still has four components, but it’s a different object. It’s called a bispinor, it’s not a four-vector.\nIn order to make a scalar quantity out of this vector, we do this transformation. We take it, we transpose it so it becomes a row. We multiply by the first matrix on the left. This is the gamma matrix. We look at this; it is a matrix as well, because the gamma is a four-by-four matrix. The mass is a scalar. But here there is a four-dimensional identity matrix in order to have the correct dimensions.\nEssentially, that way you form the Lagrangian. Then you take the Lagrange equations and you find out that the equation of motion is the Dirac equation. We like very much condensed notation. Often this contraction, these gamma matrices, is noted with a slashed symbol, a slash through the matrices.\nSo this is actually often written as: the equation of motion is (i \\not{\\partial} - m) \\psi = 0 , the Dirac equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey formulas from this section:\n\nMaxwell Lagrangian Density: \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{EM}} = -\\frac{1}{4} F_{\\mu\\nu} F^{\\mu\\nu} , where F_{\\mu\\nu} = \\partial_\\mu A_\\nu - \\partial_\\nu A_\\mu .\nGauge Transformation: A_\\mu \\rightarrow A'_\\mu = A_\\mu - \\partial_\\mu \\chi , leaving F_{\\mu\\nu} invariant.\nQED Lagrangian with Fermions: \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{QED}} = \\bar{\\psi} (i \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m) \\psi - e \\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^\\mu \\psi A_\\mu - \\frac{1}{4} F_{\\mu\\nu} F^{\\mu\\nu} .\nDirac Equation: (i \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m) \\psi = 0 or, in slash notation, (i \\not{\\partial} - m) \\psi = 0 ."

    "section": "6 Gauge Invariance and the Structure of Interactions",
    "text": "6 Gauge Invariance and the Structure of Interactions\nAnd finally we arrive at an important aspect of field theory: introducing interactions. So far, we have dealt with a theory that has no interactions. Photons have been moving by themselves without interacting with charge or anything else. The fermions here are also free-moving particles. Essentially, a particle starts moving, doesn’t see anything, and just propagates. It is a free particle with no interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: This figure represents a Feynman diagram illustrating the coupling of a fermionic field  \\psi(x)\\$  to a gauge field \\ A_$ . The interaction occurs via the electromagnetic current j^\\mu(x) = \\bar{\\psi}(x)\\,\\gamma^\\mu\\,\\psi(x), which couples to the gauge field, showing how fermions interact with gauge bosons in the Standard Model.\n\n\n\nWe now want to introduce interaction. The way to do this is guided by the gauge principle.\n\nFor the gauge invariance of the electromagnetic field, it was the shift of the field A_\\mu .\nFor fermions, gauge invariance implies changing the phase of the wave function.\n\nThe wave function \\psi for the fermion has an observable absolute value squared, but its phase is not fixed. We should be able to update this phase, which is called a phase transformation.\nThe check for gauge invariance is to perform this phase transformation and see if your Lagrangian remains invariant. It’s intuitive that you should be able to update the phase.\nWhat is tricky is that the phase can be updated differently at every point in spacetime. We are not doing a global phase rotation for all fields. Instead, we decide for every point what the phase update is.\nThis local transformation is much different because we must now account for the derivative. When we see how the Lagrangian changes under this transformation, the derivative acts not only on \\psi but also on the spacetime-dependent phase, which generates an extra term.\nSo, the Lagrangian changes to itself plus an extra term. Let’s reason through it: The derivative acting on the transformed field \\psi' = e^{i Q \\alpha(x)} \\psi will bring down a factor like -iQ \\partial_\\mu \\alpha . This extra term breaks the invariance of the free theory.\nThe solution is to replace the ordinary derivative with the covariant derivative: D_\\mu = \\partial_\\mu - i Q A_\\mu\nThe total Lagrangian for quantum electrodynamics (QED) becomes: \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{QED}} = \\bar{\\psi} (i \\gamma^\\mu D_\\mu - m) \\psi - \\frac{1}{4} F_{\\mu\\nu} F^{\\mu\\nu}\nWhat we find is that for the free Dirac theory, the Lagrangian is not gauge invariant because it changes under the phase transformation. However, if we incorporate the gauge field A_\\mu and perform the gauge transformation for both fields simultaneously, the extra term gets compensated.\n\nThe fermion field transforms as: \\psi \\rightarrow \\psi' = e^{i Q \\alpha(x)} \\psi\nThe gauge field transforms as: A_\\mu \\rightarrow A_\\mu + \\partial_\\mu \\alpha\n\nThe change in the interaction term \\bar{\\psi} i \\gamma^\\mu Q A_\\mu \\psi , due to the shift in A_\\mu , exactly cancels the unwanted term from the phase transformation of \\psi .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a super important concept: the way fields and fermions interact is driven by gauge invariance. We demand the freedom to change the phase locally at every point in spacetime, and this requirement determines how the interaction must work. The resulting interaction term in the Lagrangian is A_\\mu J^\\mu , where J^\\mu = \\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^\\mu \\psi is the fermion current.\n\n\n\nFrom this Lagrangian, if you derive the equations of motion, you won’t get just the free Dirac equation. You will have a source term, showing it’s not a free-moving field—it interacts with photons. This gives us a consistent framework for interactions.\nThe gauge principle does more than just dictate how particles interact; it determines the entire structure of the interactions. Depending on the mathematical nature of the “phase” transformation, we get different fundamental forces.\n\nIf the phase is a scalar (a simple number), you get electrodynamics (QED). There is only one type of gauge boson: the photon.\nIf the phase is a 2x2 matrix (like the Pauli matrices), you get Yang-Mills theory, which describes the weak interactions with the W ^+ , W ^- , and Z bosons.\nIf the phase is a 3x3 matrix (like the Gell-Mann matrices), you get quantum chromodynamics (QCD).\n\nThe mathematical object for the phase transformation is connected to a Lie group (U(1), SU(2), SU(3)). The dimensionality of this transformation determines the “charge space” in which the fermion field \\psi can live. For example, in electroweak theory, the left-handed quarks (up and down) form a doublet under the SU(2) transformation.\nThe general form of a non-Abelian gauge transformation is: \\psi(x) \\rightarrow \\psi'(x) = e^{i g \\alpha^a(x) T^a} \\psi(x)\nHere, T^a are the generators of the group (e.g., Pauli matrices \\sigma^a/2 for SU(2)), and \\alpha^a(x) are the spacetime-dependent parameters.\nThe corresponding covariant derivative becomes: D_\\mu = \\partial_\\mu - i g T^a A_\\mu^a\nThis ensures invariance under these more complex local transformations and leads to theories where the gauge bosons themselves carry charge and can interact with each other."

    "text": "7 Exponential Form and Group Closure\nNow, the important point when working with two exponents is to ensure we are operating within a group. If I were to write the transformations without an exponential form, I could not guarantee that combining them would yield the same type of object.\nIt is a proven result in group theory that writing a group element in exponential form ensures the result remains within the group. Therefore, if you multiply one such object by another of the same type, the product corresponds to a third object of the same exponential form.\nFor those familiar with matrix exponentials, what is e^{i \\theta_a \\lambda_a} ? To find it, you must perform a Taylor expansion: \\exp(M) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{M^n}{n!}\nand then multiply the matrix by itself repeatedly.\nThis specific matrix follows a simple pattern. I believe once you square it, the result becomes diagonal. Consequently, you can often truncate the infinite series after a certain number of terms.\nThis leads us to an even more intricate object. Here, \\lambda represents a Gell-Mann matrix, and there are eight such matrices in the SU(3) formalism.\nLet us write \\lambda_1 : \\lambda_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\nSo, what is e^{i \\theta \\lambda_1} ? It should be straightforward to compute using the series expansion, noting that \\lambda_1^2 is diagonal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exponential form U = \\exp(i \\theta_a \\lambda_a) is central to group theory in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). It guarantees closure under multiplication—the product of two SU(3) group elements remains an SU(3) element. For matrices like the Gell-Mann matrices, the Taylor series for the exponential often simplifies dramatically.\n\n\n\nI am tempted to take a shortcut. You could ask either ChatGPT or Wolfram Alpha for the answer, and it would provide it quickly. However, I am confident it is easy to derive if you think about it for a moment.\nYou may not have much time now, but I encourage you to familiarize yourself with these matrices. It is both enjoyable and crucial for this course."

    "section": "8 QCD Lagrangian and Confinement",
    "text": "8 QCD Lagrangian and Confinement\nThe last concept in this subject is that the Lagrangian for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is constructed to be invariant under the SU(3) gauge transformation.\nIts structure is not entirely different from previous gauge theories, but it has a very important distinction: the proliferation of indices. The dimensionality of objects is super important.\nOnce we have a generator T^a , where T^a = \\lambda^a/2 , it is a 3 \\times 3 matrix. Contracting it with a field yields another 3 \\times 3 matrix, which is diagonal in the color dimension. We must keep track of multiple dimensions: color, Lorentz, and the gluon field A^a_\\mu .\nAn instructive exercise is to recover the familiar terms from Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) from this framework; you will see they are essentially the color-stripped versions.\nOne crucial aspect of QCD is that it is fundamentally different because it contains a term that allows gluons to interact with themselves. Even in a theory without quarks, gluons and their self-interaction terms would remain.\nThis self-interaction term in the equations of motion means gluons behave profoundly differently from photons. These gluon self-interactions lead to the phenomenon known as confinement. The screening of color forces works in the opposite way to the screening of electric forces in QED.\nIn a proper field theory course, you learn that the strength of interactions depends on the energy scale at which you probe the system, a concept related to renormalization. Depending on the energy scale of your experiment, you effectively experience a different charge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe QCD Lagrangian contains the strong coupling constant g_s , which is “bare” in the Lagrangian. However, the coupling you observe in interactions is not this bare constant—it changes with the energy scale. This running is described by the QCD beta function: \\beta(\\alpha_s) = \\frac{d\\alpha_s}{d\\ln Q} = -\\frac{\\alpha_s^2}{2\\pi} \\left( 11 - \\frac{2}{3} n_f \\right) + \\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^3)\nwhere \\alpha_s = g_s^2/(4\\pi) and n_f is the number of quark flavors. The negative sign is key: it means \\alpha_s decreases at high energies (asymptotic freedom) and increases at low energies (confinement).\n\n\n\nFor QED, the coupling constant becomes smaller as you probe shorter distances (higher energy). For the strong interaction, the coupling constant g_s becomes stronger as you reduce the energy scale.\nThis increasing strength at low energies is the reason hadrons can form. Gluons and quarks bind into hadrons at these small energy scales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The diagram shows the dependence of the strong coupling  \\alpha\\_s(Q)\\$  on the transferred momentum \\ Q$ . At high  Q\\$ , the coupling decreases, illustrating the property of asymptotic freedom. At low \\ Q$ , the coupling grows, leading to the non-perturbative regime of QCD and the phenomenon of confinement. The transition scale is set by  \\Lambda\\_{\\text{QCD}} \\sim 300\\ \\text{MeV}\\$ , and for \\ Q  $ perturbative methods fail, marking the domain of confinement and hadronization.\n\n\n\nThe strong interaction is such that it does not allow colored objects (like individual quarks) to escape; it confines them. The high-energy regime where the coupling is small is called asymptotic freedom.\nThe root cause of both confinement and asymptotic freedom is the gluon self-interaction. There is essentially no “free” theory for QCD; even without quarks, gluons interact. This self-interaction leads to confinement at low energy and asymptotic freedom at high energy. The latter regime is where we perform calculations for processes like Higgs physics, where large momentum transfers occur.\nAn aspect not discussed in detail today is what Quantum Field Theory (QFT) tells us about performing computations in perturbation theory. In QED, or in the asymptotic freedom regime of QCD where the coupling is small, you can expand your equations of motion and iterate using the fact that the coupling is small.\nThis leads to the perturbative approach, with its diagrammatic representation known as Feynman diagrams. Using these, you compute matrix elements.\nIn this course, we will often refer to the matrix element squared |\\mathcal{M}|^2 , which is related to the cross section \\sigma of a process. The general formula for a 2 \\to N scattering cross section is: \\sigma = \\frac{1}{2E_A 2E_B |v_A - v_B|} \\int \\left( \\prod_{f=1}^N \\frac{d^3p_f}{(2\\pi)^3 2E_f} \\right) |\\mathcal{M}|^2 (2\\pi)^4 \\delta^{(4)} \\left( p_A + p_B - \\sum p_f \\right)\nHere, \\Phi represents the flux factor, and D\\Phi stands for the integration over the final-state particle phase space.\nThe matrix element in QFT is the key object that relates theory to observables. It tells you how to compute quantities you can measure in an experiment.\nIntuitively, you can understand it this way:\n\nThe matrix element \\mathcal{M} gives the quantum mechanical amplitude for a transition from an initial state to a specific final state.\n|\\mathcal{M}|^2 is proportional to the probability for that specific configuration.\nTo get the total probability, you must sum over all possible final-state configurations (integrate over phase space D\\Phi ).\n\nYou will see an example next week of how, for a two-body decay, you explicitly count the number of configurations in the final state. The total probability (or decay rate) will be this matrix element squared, summed over all possible configurations.\nIn these calculations, you must also account for particle spins:\n\nSum over the spin states of the final particles.\nAverage over the spin states of the initial particles.\n\nThis is why for a process like A + B \\to N , we include averaging factors. If you are given a correctly spin-averaged matrix element, along with the 1/(2E) factors for incoming particles, you can immediately calculate the corresponding cross section.\nThe cross section \\sigma  has units of area (e.g., cm ^2 ). It represents the effective “target area” presented by one particle to another. If the colliding particles pass within this area, the reaction is likely to occur; outside of it, the reaction does not happen.\nThe decay width \\Gamma  is related to the lifetime \\tau of an unstable particle ( \\tau = 1/\\Gamma ). For a particle of mass M decaying to N final particles, the partial width is: \\Gamma = \\frac{1}{2M} \\int \\left( \\prod_{f=1}^N \\frac{d^3p_f}{(2\\pi)^3 2E_f} \\right) |\\mathcal{M}|^2 (2\\pi)^4 \\delta^{(4)}\\left( p - \\sum p_f \\right)\nWe will discuss this formula in more detail next time."

    "section": "9 Course Logistics and Introduction",
    "text": "9 Course Logistics and Introduction\nIt’s really nice to have you all today. We are three minutes out, but let me quickly go over the logistics for the course.\n\nI have prepared notes for 11 lectures and 11 exercises (though there will be fewer exercises due to some breaks).\nA calendar is available on Moodle listing the anticipated dates for lectures and exercises. Closer to those dates, we can discuss shifting exercise sessions, but for now, we will keep the schedule as is.\nFor the exam, we will track the points you gain through the exercise sheets during the semester. Achieving 50% of these points will admit you to the examination.\nThe exam itself is designed to be straightforward: you will receive the problem one or two weeks in advance to think about it.\nDuring the exam, you will bring your solutions, and we will have a discussion about the material.\n\nI think the most important thing is to work on the exercise sheets during the semester. Let me show them to you.\n\nThere is a barcode to scan on the sheets.\nThere will be one or two problems per homework that you must solve.\nProcess: You write your solutions down, bring the solved sheets to the lecture, and place them in a designated box. We will check them, and the teaching assistants will return the marked sheets during the Thursday exercise sessions, where they will also discuss the problems.\nSchedule: Lectures are on Tuesday, and exercise sessions are on Thursday.\n\nWe will have a certain excursion during the semester. Although it’s fully booked, we may still find one or two places if you haven’t signed up.\n\nOffice Hours: I will hold office hours on Thursdays from 9:00 to 10:00 in my office, 1 3B and B. You can come to discuss anything related to the course. This will be written down officially.\n\nThere are several summer schools happening in our field this summer. These are exciting events if you’re considering going to a different country.\n\nOne is in Zurich, Switzerland, for eight weeks.\nAnother is in Krakow, Poland, for four weeks.\nApplications for these are still open for another couple of weeks.\nWe are also organizing one in Bochum in July for two weeks, aimed at people more advanced in the field.\n\nIf you are interested, just write me an email, and I can forward you the official announcement.\nRegarding the exercise sheets, I encourage collaboration. You can solve the sheets together and feel free to use any resources—ChatGPT, books, etc. The problems are standard and are meant for learning, not for checking you. How you learn is up to you.\nHere are some of the key textbooks I will be following:\n\nHalzen and Martin\nMartin Schmaltz (dedicated to Higgs physics)\nThomson’s Particle Physics\n\nThe exercise sessions start this week. Before leaving, please take the sheets. We printed 15 copies; there are two sheets, each with two pages. Take one for yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Today’s Problem: The first problem involves a coupled spring-pendulum system. The pivot point from which the pendulum hangs can slide. You will start from the Lagrangian, which is the kinetic energy minus the potential energy, and work towards finding relevant equations of motion.\nA typical Lagrangian for such a coupled system is: L = \\frac{1}{2} m \\dot{x}^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m l^2 \\dot{\\theta}^2 + m l \\dot{x} \\dot{\\theta} \\cos\\theta - \\frac{1}{2} k x^2 - m g l (1 - \\cos\\theta)\nHere, \\dot{x} is the time derivative of the sliding coordinate, and the terms represent kinetic energy from sliding and rotation, a coupling term, and potential energy from the spring and gravity.\n\n\n\nThis is a fun problem. You can put the derived equations into a differential equation solver. It’s not that easy in quantum field theory, but people still do it in their research.\nI rushed a bit at the beginning and end, so let me clarify the plan. I will reintroduce the QED Lagrangian and the QCD Lagrangian. We will calculate something for QED as well, time permitting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Lagrangian for QED: The Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) Lagrangian describes the interaction between fermions (like electrons) and the electromagnetic field. It is given by: \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{QED}} = \\bar{\\psi}(i\\gamma^\\mu D_\\mu - m)\\psi - \\frac{1}{4} F_{\\mu\\nu} F^{\\mu\\nu}\nIn this formula, D_\\mu = \\partial_\\mu + i e A_\\mu is the covariant derivative, and F_{\\mu\\nu} is the electromagnetic field tensor.\n\n\n\nI think starting with a simpler case and explaining how you calculate the terms is a good approach. I’ve prepared an exercise on gauge transformations for QED. This will provide a useful comparison to understand the added complexity that QCD brings. While QED explains most electromagnetic interactions, QCD introduces further complexity.\nI think we should proceed. Let’s get started."

    "text": "1 Estimating Hadronic Cross Sections\nSo how were the problems from the homework? I think when you study particle physics, you have several courses and some problems you do a few times because they appear first in nuclear physics and then maybe in particle physics or quantum field theory. You do Clebsch-Gordan coefficients four times because that’s how it is; it’s so important. So it will be homework for this week. There will be some Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and I hope you won’t have troubles with that.\nToday’s lecture we will discuss more about the symmetries in hadron physics. We will start with QCD as we discussed before with the SU(3) group and then move to the phenomenology of the SU(3) flavor group. We will discuss isospin and then discuss SU(3) flavor by interchanging up and down quarks. We will connect this to the Lorentz group which has SU(2) as a subgroup responsible for rotations. You will see how the addition of spin has something to do with the addition of the quarks inside hadrons.\nI will remind you of a lot of material from quantum mechanics that you’ve seen already and I hope it will be easy to follow. I particularly enjoy this part because this is something you can derive once you isolate yourself from books and the Internet. You can just sit and work through this really nice spin algebra.\nLet me start by reminding you of the last lecture with a few questions. The first one I would like to ask is to remind you of the previous lecture. How would you estimate the typical cross section of hadronic reactions? Just an order of magnitude.\nIf I want just an order of magnitude, what would I do? You would take the integral over all possible configurations of the matrix element squared. If you know the matrix element, then you can calculate the cross section by summing over all final states:\n\\sigma = \\frac{1}{4\\sqrt{(p_1\\cdot p_2)^2-m_1^2m_2^2}} \\frac{1}{N_i} \\sum_{f} |\\mathcal{M}_{if}|^2 d\\Phi_n\nThis will give you an exact value for the cross section in units of inverse GeV, which you can convert to centimeters squared. That’s a good approach, and this is what we will do once we know the matrix element.\nThis is for a particular process. Here I assume that I know the initial state and the final state. This matrix element gives me the transition from the initial state to the final state. This is the particular cross section for the initial state scattering to that specific final state. If I want the total cross section, I sum over all possible final states. Since different final states are orthogonal to each other, there is no quantum coherence or interference between them, so I can just sum them up. This is the precise method.\nBut I want a number. What is the scale we are dealing with? What should we expect for the size of a cross section? The units of cross section is the barn. One barn is equal to 10^{-24} \\, \\text{cm}^2 .\nSo how do we get the order of barns? What is the cross section? Imagine that you fix your target particle, say a proton, at a certain point and you hit it with another proton. The cross section gives you the effective area in space. Once you hit this little area, the reaction happens. If you go outside, the reaction does not happen. So you can think of it literally as an area in space.\nWhat would this area be? It is the effective area of the interaction. How do I estimate this? By the scale of the strong interaction, by the size of the proton. Think of it as a solid ball. The strong interaction range is about one fermi, which is 10^{-15} meters or 10^{-13} centimeters.\nThe cross section is on the order of \\pi R^2 . That’s the area. For a radius R \\approx 1 \\, \\text{fm} , we get \\sigma \\approx \\pi \\times (10^{-13} \\, \\text{cm})^2 . This is on the order of 10^{-26} \\, \\text{cm}^2 , or about 10 millibarns. If you calculate the total cross section for hadrons, you’re going to get values around that scale because the way they interact is by essentially overlapping their densities. If they are far away from each other, they never talk to each other. The strong interaction is really strong, but it’s short-range.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Estimation: The geometric cross section provides a quick order-of-magnitude estimate for hadronic reactions: \\sigma \\approx \\pi R^2 . For a proton radius R \\approx 1 \\, \\text{fm} = 10^{-13} \\, \\text{cm} , this yields \\sigma \\approx 3 \\times 10^{-26} \\, \\text{cm}^2 , or about 30 millibarns. This scale is typical because the interaction probability is essentially unity within the effective area defined by the particle’s size."

    "section": "2 Defining Charge via Conserved Currents",
    "text": "2 Defining Charge via Conserved Currents\nThe second question I thought of is: how do I define charge in QED and QCD?\nFirst, what is the charge in QED? We can pick the electric charge as the prime example.\n\n2.1 Defining Charge via Noether’s Theorem\nDo you remember how I defined the charge? If I’m given a field, say a spinor \\psi , how do I figure out its charge?\nThe charge is a conserved quantity for the particles. For a free moving field, its charge isn’t changing. This conservation arises from a symmetry, and Noether’s theorem tells us there is a corresponding conserved current.\nThe charge is defined as the integral of the zero component (the time component) of this conserved current: Q = \\int d^3x \\, j^0\nFor a Dirac field \\psi in QED, this conserved current from the global U(1) symmetry is: j^\\mu = \\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^\\mu \\psi\nwhere \\bar{\\psi} = \\psi^\\dagger \\gamma^0 is the Dirac adjoint.\nIf we look specifically at the charge density j^0 : j^0 = \\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^0 \\psi = \\psi^\\dagger \\gamma^0 \\gamma^0 \\psi\nSince \\gamma^0 \\gamma^0 = I (the identity matrix), this simplifies to: j^0 = \\psi^\\dagger \\psi\nThis is a positive quantity for Dirac field solutions.\n\n\n2.2 Reconciling Theory with Convention\nThis leads to an implication: if my \\psi field represents an electron, the Noether charge Q would be positive. At first, this seems like a contradiction because we know the electron has negative electric charge.\nThe resolution is that the conserved quantity Q from field theory is what’s fundamentally conserved. How we match it to our physical observations—like the electron having charge -e —is a matter of convention.\nWe define the observed charge to match our conventions: Q_{\\text{observed}} = -e \\int d^3x \\, \\psi^\\dagger \\psi\nSo, it doesn’t matter what constant you put in front; the crucial point from field theory is that this quantity Q is conserved. Scaling it by a factor (like -e ) to match experiment is our choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis discussion focuses on electric charge in QED, arising from a U(1) symmetry. A similar logic applies to color charge in QCD, but it originates from a more complex SU(3) gauge symmetry. The conserved currents in QCD involve color indices and matrices (like the Gell-Mann matrices T^a ), leading to eight conserved color charges."

    "text": "3 Currents and Charges in QED and QCD\nThe electromagnetic current in QED is often denoted as J^\\mu or j^\\mu , where: j^\\mu = -e \\, \\bar{\\psi} \\gamma^\\mu \\psi\nThis is the conserved Noether current associated with the U(1) gauge symmetry of QED.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: This figure represents the process of probing (measuring or interacting with) electric charge using a photon. In the context of the lecture, this illustrates how, in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), a photon couples to a charged particle (such as an electron) via an interaction vertex, allowing experimental or theoretical access to the particle’s electric charge. The wavy line corresponds to the photon, and the adjoining straight line represents the charged particle (like an electron or quark). This is a fundamental concept because the photon is the mediator of electromagnetic interactions, and its coupling directly measures the conserved electric charge associated with the U(1) symmetry of QED, as discussed when introducing conserved currents and Noether’s theorem.\n\n\n\nThe factor -e is a convention to match our common definition of electric charge (electrons have negative charge). We could have defined electrons as positively charged, but that is not our standard convention.So, how do we define the analogous charge in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)? We follow a similar logic. In QED, a photon couples to a fermion via a vertex with \\gamma^\\mu , probing its electric charge through the current. (see Figure 1) For QCD, we want a vertex that probes color charge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe color current in QCD is the conserved non-Abelian current associated with the SU(3) gauge symmetry. It couples to the gluon fields and describes the flow of color charge, which has eight components corresponding to the eight gluons: j^{\\mu,\\,a} = g_s \\, \\bar{\\psi}_i \\gamma^\\mu (T^a)_{ij} \\psi_j\nHere, g_s is the strong coupling constant, \\psi_i is the Dirac spinor field for a quark with a color index i = 1,2,3 (representing red, green, blue), and (T^a)_{ij} are the Gell-Mann matrices (the generators of SU(3) ) with a = 1, \\dots, 8 .\n\n\n\nThe construction is very similar:\n\nThe quarks are still fermions, so we use the Dirac spinor \\psi , but now it carries a color index.\nAt the vertex, we still have a \\gamma^\\mu , but we must also include a Gell-Mann matrix T^A to account for the non-Abelian SU(3) structure.\n\nTherefore, the QCD vertex factor becomes \\gamma^\\mu T^A . Given a specific quark field \\psi , we can insert it into the current j^{\\mu,\\,a} to compute its color charge.\nA key result is that the color charge of a quark is not a single number like “red,” “green,” or “blue.” Instead, for a given quark state, you compute a vector of eight numbers, one for each gluon type (each generator T^a ).\n\nHow many color charges does QCD have? Eight, corresponding to the index a on the current j^{\\mu,\\,a} .\n\nFor example, consider a quark with a specific color state in the fundamental representation: \\psi_{\\text{color}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ i\\sqrt{3} \\end{pmatrix}\nTo find its color charge, you compute the eight numbers given by the expectation value of the color charge operator Q^a_{\\text{QCD}} = g_s \\int d^3x \\, \\psi_i^\\dagger \\gamma^0 (T^a)_{ij} \\psi_j for this state. Depending on which gluon (labeled by index a ) you use to probe the quark, you will get a different component of this charge vector. All eight components are computed using the same fundamental equation for the color current."

    "text": "4 SU(2) Group: Representations, Generators, and Physical Charges\nSo then this comes from group theory. Here we deal with U(1), U(2), SU(2), and SU(3). Today we will be discussing SU(2). We are finishing here with a recap and moving to the discussion of today’s SU(2) group.\nThe SU(2) group is a super important symmetry in particle physics. First, it’s a group. Let’s start by discussing a few words on what a group is.\nA group is defined by a set of elements with a composition rule. For any element G in the group, there exists an inverse G^{-1} that is also in the group. For any two elements G_1 and G_2 , their composition G_1 \\circ G_2 also belongs to the group. Finally, there is an identity element.\nSU(2) is a special unitary group. It is the group of 2 \\times 2 unitary matrices with determinant one. An element U \\in SU(2) satisfies: U^\\dagger U = U U^\\dagger = I, \\quad \\det(U) = 1\nThe letter S stands for “special,” meaning the determinant is exactly one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the fundamental representation of SU(2). A representation is a way of realizing the group’s elements as matrices acting on a vector space. The fundamental representation acts on a 2-dimensional (complex) vector space.\n\n\n\nWe could imagine listing all matrices in the group, but it’s not possible because the group is continuous and infinite. However, if we could list them, we would know how they compose—multiplying two group elements gives another group element. To construct other representations, we find a correspondence where each group element is mapped to a matrix in a different dimension (e.g., 3 \\times 3 or 4 \\times 4 ) while preserving the group multiplication rules. SU(2) is a nice group because it has a straightforward way of constructing representations of any dimension.\nAnother key concept from group theory is the Lie algebra. All group elements near the identity can be generated from the algebra. For SU(2), the generators are the Pauli matrices, \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3 . Any group element can be written in exponential form: U = \\exp\\left(i \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\theta_i \\sigma_i\\right)\nwhere \\theta_i are real parameters.\nThe matrix exponential is defined via its Taylor expansion: \\exp(M) = I + M + \\frac{M^2}{2!} + \\frac{M^3}{3!} + \\cdots\nFor certain matrices where M^2 = 0 , the series terminates at I + M . In general, you compute it by summing the series.\nThe generators obey the defining commutation relations of the \\mathfrak{su}(2) algebra: [\\sigma_i, \\sigma_j] = 2i \\epsilon_{ijk} \\sigma_k\nThese relations hold for the generators in any representation of SU(2). For the fundamental representation, the Pauli matrices satisfy this exactly.\nThis group is important in two major physical applications:\n\nSpin: Spin is a quantity that arises from the SU(2) symmetry related to rotations in space. For a three-vector, rotations are given by 3 \\times 3 rotation matrices. For a spinor (like an electron’s wavefunction), rotations are represented by the Pauli matrices.\nFlavor Symmetry: We can apply SU(2) to quark flavor, specifically mixing up and down quarks. Continuous transformations between up and down quark states are characterized similarly to rotating a spinor, but in flavor space.\n\nThe first application (spin) you’ve likely seen in quantum mechanics. Before moving on, let’s connect these groups to a physical concept: charge.\n\nIn QED (U(1) symmetry), the conserved charge is electric charge.\nIn QCD (SU(3) symmetry), the conserved charge is color charge.\n\nWhat is the charge for our SU(2) symmetries? We can compute it using Noether’s theorem. For a symmetry with generators T^a , the conserved charge is: Q^a = \\int d^3x \\, \\psi^\\dagger T^a \\psi\n\nFor the rotation (spin) group: We replace T^a with the Pauli matrices. The resulting charges S_1, S_2, S_3 correspond to the projections of the spin along the x, y, and z axes. They are related to the particle’s helicity, which is the projection of spin along the direction of motion: h = \\frac{\\mathbf{S} \\cdot \\mathbf{p}}{|\\mathbf{p}|} .\nFor the flavor group: We again use Pauli matrices, but now the wavefunction \\psi describes quark flavor (up and down). The resulting conserved charge is a new quantity called isospin.\n\nIn summary, the SU(2) algebra, with its commutation relations [\\sigma_i, \\sigma_j] = 2i \\epsilon_{ijk} \\sigma_k , underlies the physics of both spin and isospin."

    "text": "5 SU(2) Representations and the Construction of Generators\nI am given the commutation relation [J_i, J_j] = i \\varepsilon_{ijk} J_k . This defines the Lie algebra of the SU(2) group, where \\varepsilon_{ijk} is the Levi-Civita symbol.\nLet me write it more quickly. Essentially, this means the generators J_1 , J_2 , and J_3 satisfy three fundamental relations. From this algebra, you get the three generators.\nSo \\sigma_3 is the one that will give you the Pauli matrices as well. Just to remind you, the Pauli matrices in the fundamental ( j=1/2 ) representation are: \\sigma_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\sigma_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\sigma_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}.\nFortunately, there is no different convention for these; we all use the same.\nIt’s extremely important to ask: how many of the generators of the group have a diagonal form? This is a fundamental group theory question. All generators must be traceless because the condition for a matrix to have determinant one implies a relation between the determinant and the trace. Essentially, for these group elements, the determinant is equal to the exponential of the trace.\nBut it’s important to know how many are diagonal, because this tells you what the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are that you are going to deal with. For SU(2), there is just one matrix that is diagonal in the standard basis. That’s why the group is called rank one. If you go to a group theory class, you will see fascinating classifications of all possible groups that heavily rely on the rank of the group. For SU(2) the rank is equal to 1.\nThis diagonal matrix will be used to construct and determine physical quantities from the states.\nWe are now going to act with these matrices on the states. We will use the ket notation |J M\\rangle for the states, which implies a unit vector with only one non-zero component at the position corresponding to M .\nWe will use a lot of this notation. The label J gives you the dimension of the representation. We will discuss the spin applications of this group first, where J determines the dimension in the sense that every component corresponds to a certain possible value of the projection of the spin. There are 2J + 1 possible projections.\nThe physical picture is that we have a spin vector \\mathbf{J} and a quantization axis. Along this axis, there are several possible projections: -J, -J+1, ..., +J . The number of them is 2J+1 .\n\nJ = 1/2 corresponds to the two-dimensional representation. That’s fundamental. The basis states are |1/2, 1/2\\rangle and |1/2, -1/2\\rangle .\nThose Pauli matrices (divided by 2) are the generators for this fundamental representation, where the matrix acts on the vector space spanned by these two states.\nAny other state, like |3/2, -1/2\\rangle , lives in a larger vector space. This is just notation for the vector space. We construct any group element acting on that space using our generators. Okay, let’s look quickly at the lowering and raising operators. We define: J_+ = J_1 + i J_2, \\quad J_- = J_1 - i J_2.\nThese are the raising and lowering operators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: This figure represents the mathematical expression for the construction of ladder operators, which are essential tools in the spin algebra of the SU(2) group discussed in the lecture. Specifically, it shows the definition of the raising and lowering operators: [ J_+ = J_1 + i J_2 ] and [ J_- = J_1 - i J_2 ] These operators act on quantum states labeled by total spin J and projection M , raising or lowering the value of M by one unit. They are fundamental for building the algebraic structure of angular momentum in quantum mechanics and are directly related to the manipulation of spin and isospin quantum numbers, as well as understanding how multiplets (like baryons and mesons) are constructed and how their quantum numbers combine. The ability to use these operators enables the calculation of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and the systematic construction of higher spin and isospin representations, which are recurring themes of the lecture.\n\n\n\nTheir action on a state will lower or increase the projection quantum number M .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: This diagram represents the action of the SU(2) spin algebra operators on angular momentum eigenstates labeled by the quantum number M (the projection of total angular momentum or isospin along the quantization axis). Along the horizontal axis, different M states are shown as points. - J_3 is the operator corresponding to the projection of the angular momentum; it leaves the state unchanged except for multiplying by M . - The upward arrow labeled J_+ indicates the raising operator, which acts on a state |J, M\\rangle to increase M by one unit ( J_+ |J, M\\rangle \\propto |J, M+1\\rangle ). - The downward arrow labeled J_- indicates the lowering operator, which decreases M by one unit ( J_- |J, M\\rangle \\propto |J, M-1\\rangle ). This figure demonstrates the ladder structure of spin or isospin multiplets as dictated by the SU(2) Lie algebra: raising and lowering operators connect the different states within the same multiplet, illustrating how the total space of representations is constructed. This is crucial for understanding how quantum numbers change under these operators—an essential part of both spin and isospin algebra in particle physics.\n\n\n\nThe J_+ operator acting on a lower state will move the vector to the upper one.\nTo demonstrate their properties, consider the product: J_+ J_- = (J_1 + i J_2)(J_1 - i J_2) = J_1^2 + J_2^2 - i[J_1, J_2].\nUsing the commutation relation [J_1, J_2] = i J_3 , this becomes: J_+ J_- = J_1^2 + J_2^2 + J_3 = \\mathbf{J}^2 - J_3^2 + J_3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe action of the operators on an eigenstate |J M\\rangle is defined by: J_3 |J M\\rangle = M |J M\\rangle, \\quad \\mathbf{J}^2 |J M\\rangle = J(J+1) |J M\\rangle.\nThese operators commute with each other and, in quantum mechanics, with a rotationally invariant Hamiltonian, making them conserved quantities.\n\n\n\nTherefore, J_+ J_- acting on |J M\\rangle gives [J(J+1) - M(M-1)] |J M\\rangle . From this, we find the action of the ladder operators themselves:\nJ_+ |J M\\rangle = \\sqrt{J(J+1) - M(M+1)} \\, |J, M+1\\rangle,\nJ_- |J M\\rangle = \\sqrt{J(J+1) - M(M-1)} \\, |J, M-1\\rangle.\nThe square root factors ensure the states remain normalized. This structure is very closely related to what we will see later with Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\nSo, let’s give the method to construct an arbitrary representation. Imagine you want an analog of the Pauli matrices for, say, a four-dimensional representation.\nFirst, construct J_+ . For a dimension d=4 representation, the corresponding spin is j , where 2j+1 = 4 , so j = 3/2 . The operator J_+ acts on a state and moves the projection up by one. Therefore, its matrix will have non-zero elements only on the first off-diagonal. For example, one element would be J_+ |3/2, 1/2\\rangle = \\sqrt{3} |3/2, 3/2\\rangle .\nIt’s often easier to construct J_- first. For instance: J_- |3/2, 1/2\\rangle = \\sqrt{3} \\, |3/2, -1/2\\rangle.\nThis tells you one specific matrix element. You fill the J_- matrix with the appropriate square-root factors on the first sub-diagonal, and then J_+ is its Hermitian conjugate.\nOnce you have J_+ and J_- , you recover the original generators: J_1 = \\frac{J_+ + J_-}{2}, \\quad J_2 = \\frac{J_+ - J_-}{2i},\nand J_3 is the diagonal matrix with eigenvalues m = -j, -j+1, ..., j on the diagonal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Algorithm: For a representation of dimension d = 2j+1 , the diagonal entries of J_3 are m from -j to j in integer steps. Use the formula J_\\pm |j, m\\rangle = \\sqrt{j(j+1) - m(m \\pm 1)} \\, |j, m \\pm 1\\rangle to populate the J_+ and J_- matrices, then construct J_1 and J_2 .\n\n\n\nNow the fun part: to get finite rotations, you exponentiate these generators. A general SU(2) group element is given by: U(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}) = \\exp(-i \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\cdot \\mathbf{J}).\nYou don’t do this manually for large representations; you use a computer. What we have discussed so far is how to construct an arbitrary matrix representation of the SU(2) group."

    "text": "6 The Ξ Baryons and Isospin Symmetry\nThe Ξ baryons (the Greek letter xi) are found in the Review of Particle Physics (PDG). Their quark content consists of two strange quarks and one light quark (either up or down).\n\nThe charged state is the Ξ⁻, with quark content (s s d) .\nThe neutral state is the Ξ⁰, with quark content (s s u) .\n\nIf you look at the PDG, these two particles have very similar properties—their masses are very close, and they are essentially the same particle, just with different electric charge.\nAnother example is the Ξ_c baryons.\n\nThe upper one in the isospin doublet is the Ξ_c⁺, with quark content (c s u) .\nThe lower one is the Ξ_c⁰, with quark content (c s d) .\n\nThese are all well-known, discovered particles. They have very similar masses and very similar lifetimes; essentially, they look like the same particle.\nThe third member of this family is the Ξ_cc baryon, a doubly-charmed state.\n\nThe upper state would be the Ξ_cc^{++}, with quark content (c c u) .\nThe lower state is the Ξ_cc^{+}, with quark content (c c d) .\n\nThe Ξ_cc^{++} ** has been discovered. However, the **Ξ_cc^{+}  is frequently discussed at conferences. One experiment reported a signal-like bump, but another experiment, LHCb, did not find it at the expected mass. Moreover, LHCb found a candidate for the Ξ_cc^{+} $ with a mass that was in conflict—about 40 MeV different from the mass of the state seen previously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is this discrepancy scandalous? Because, so far, whenever you replace an up quark with a down quark (or vice versa), the particle’s mass almost does not change and its properties remain the same. This is due to strong isospin symmetry, which arises because the strong interaction is essentially blind to the difference between up and down quarks, given their very similar masses:$ m_u m_d .\nFor the _{cc} $states, it would be impossible for them to have significantly different masses under this symmetry. They must have nearly identical properties.\n\n\n\nIf you were to do a PhD on data analysis and discover the Ξ_cc^{+}$ , you would become a superstar in particle physics. There have been several PhD projects dedicated to searching for it. The search often involves a blind analysis: researchers define the reactions and a mass window to study, but they do not look at the data in that window until all selection criteria and procedures are optimized and fixed. Only then do they “unblind” the mass range.\nFour PhD students completed this rigorous process, pressed the button to unblind their data, and unfortunately found nothing there. The challenge is likely in picking the right decay channel. The Ξ_cc^{+} $ decays through many modes, and current statistics may be insufficient to see it in some of the rarer ones. The right decay mode probably exists—we just haven’t found it yet."

    "text": "7 Symmetry, Isospin, and Combining Representations\n\n7.1 Symmetry of QCD\nWhen we speak about the symmetries of the Lagrangian of QCD, we have in mind the Lagrangian itself. It has a term for the gluons and a term for the quarks. This term for the quarks—the Dirac term—contains a mass parameter. If the quark masses are not the same, this mass term will break the flavor symmetry.\nFor the u and d quarks, since they have almost the same masses, this symmetry is not broken by the mass terms, and it remains a good symmetry. In contrast, the mass of the strange quark is about 100 MeV. Therefore, the symmetry between the u, d, and s quarks—the SU(3) flavor symmetry—is only approximate.\n\n\n7.2 Isospin SU(2) Symmetry\nLet’s focus on the u and d quarks. Their near-equal mass means rotations in this two-dimensional flavor space are a good symmetry. This is the SU(2) isospin symmetry.\nThe transformation under this SU(2) group for a doublet like$ (u, d) $is given by: U(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}) = e^{-i \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\tau} / 2}\nwhere \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} are the rotation parameters and \\boldsymbol{\\tau} are the Pauli matrices. This is mathematically identical to how we describe spin rotations in quantum mechanics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe particle historically named cascade is denoted by the Greek letter Ξ (Xi). Because its decay chain resembled a cascade of particles, and the Greek name can be challenging to pronounce, it’s commonly just called “cascade” in particle physics.\n\n\n\nIn this framework, treating the u and d quarks as an isospin doublet (like spin-1/2), a particle like the cascade (Ξ) can be assigned an isospin wave function.\n\nThe dimension of the representation tells us the isospin quantum number. For a representation of dimension d , the isospin I is given by d = 2I + 1 .\nA doublet ( d=2 ) corresponds to isospin I = 1/2 .\nA quartet ( d=4 ) corresponds to isospin I = 3/2 .\n\n\n\n7.3 Combining Representations: Higher Multiplets\nA natural question arises: if we only have two quarks (u and d) in an I=1/2 doublet, how do we get particles with higher isospin, like I=1 or I=3/2 ?\nThe answer is by combining quarks. When we build composite particles (like baryons and mesons) from multiple quarks, we must combine their individual isospins (and spins) to find the total isospin of the composite system. The rules for combining isospin are identical to the rules for combining angular momentum (spin).\nAngular Momentum Addition Rule: When combining two systems with spins j_1 and j_2 , the total spin j can take values: j = |j_1 - j_2|, \\, |j_1 - j_2| + 1, \\, \\dots, \\, j_1 + j_2\nThis is written as j_1 \\otimes j_2 = |j_1-j_2| \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus (j_1+j_2) .\nKey Examples:\n\nCombining two spin-1/2 particles (e.g., two quarks in an isospin doublet): \\frac{1}{2} \\otimes \\frac{1}{2} = 1 \\oplus 0\nThis yields a triplet ( I=1 , dimension 3) and a singlet ( I=0 , dimension 1).\nCombining spin-3 and spin-2: 3 \\otimes 2 = 1 \\oplus 2 \\oplus 3 \\oplus 4 \\oplus 5\n\nA powerful consistency check is that the total dimension must be conserved: \\text{Dim}(j_1) \\times \\text{Dim}(j_2) = \\sum_{j=|j_1-j_2|}^{j_1+j_2} \\text{Dim}(j)\nFor example, with j_1=3 (dimension 7) and j_2=2 (dimension 5): 7 \\times 5 = 35 , and 1+3+5+7+9+11 = 35 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup theory tells us that when we combine representations, the resulting higher-dimensional space breaks into blocks that do not mix under symmetry transformations (rotations in isospin or spin space). Each block corresponds to a distinct total spin/isospin value. This is why, for instance, a system with total spin 3 can never rotate into a state with total spin 4. ### Practical Application & Final Notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: This figure illustrates the concept of angular momentum projection in quantum mechanics, specifically in the context of SU(2) symmetry, as used for both spin and isospin in particle physics. The arrow labeled “spin” represents the angular momentum vector \\vec{J} (or “spin”), while the slanted line labeled “projection axis” represents the quantization axis—customarily chosen as the z -axis for calculations. The diagram emphasizes how, for a system with total angular momentum J , only certain discrete projections M along the chosen axis are allowed ( M = -J, -J+1, ..., J ). This is a direct visualization of the concept behind the eigenstates |J\\, M\\rangle , with M being the quantum number corresponding to the component of \\vec{J} along the projection axis. This foundational idea underlies much of the spin algebra, angular momentum addition, and isospin formalism discussed throughout the lecture.\n\n\n\nBefore moving to practical combinations, let’s briefly introduce the concepts of parity and charge conjugation.\nCrucial Distinction: It is vital not to mix up isospin and spin.\n\nWe use isospin SU(2) when constructing the flavor wave function of quarks inside a hadron.\nWe use the rotational SU(2) (from the Lorentz group) when combining the intrinsic spin of particles to understand angular momentum and related dependencies.\n\nThe mathematical algebra and combination rules are identical for both; the only difference is the physical context in which they are applied."

    "text": "8 Parity, Charge Conjugation, and Excitations of the Λc Baryon\nSo parity and charge conjugation quickly number 3, 4, 5. The parity operator is doing inversion. Both parity and charge conjugation are operators that act on a state and produce another state.\nThe parity operator \\hat{P} is space inversion with respect to the origin. Charge conjugation \\hat{C} is the operator flipping all charges, turning a particle into its antiparticle.\nAnswer the question: how do wave functions of the particle change when you flip the wave functions through the origin? It’s rather intuitive. You have a vector, you flip through the origin all of the spatial components, and you get the vector pointing in the opposite direction.\nFor any particle you can find out what its parity is. The parity acting on the state gives the eigenvalue. Since you act twice and get the same state—you do flip twice you get the initial configuration—the eigenvalue of this operator is modulus 1. By convention we say it’s real and then we say it’s plus or minus one, either +1 or -1 : \\hat{P} | \\psi \\rangle = \\pm | \\psi \\rangle .\nConnecting to the charge conjugation operator, acting on this state you get the same state if the particle or the wave function that you consider here is neutral, and for the charged one you get a different one. That’s what prime here stands for.\nFor any particle you can look up what its charge conjugation is, but not for every particle you find it. For every particle you can find parity. Let me give you the convention. Essentially, if the particle is the neutral one in the multiplet, the charge conjugation is the one that’s C is a member of the multiplet.\nSo the charge conjugation C of \\pi^+ or \\pi^0 is equal to—the Particle Data Group is the book that has a lot of information on all particles—would tell you these quantum numbers. For any particle you find the J^{PC} , which is the spin, total spin of the particle, parity, and charge conjugation.\nThink for all of them, for baryons, for the charged ones, for the neutral ones, you’ll find that J^{PC} is—spin is equal to 0, minus, plus 1—and for the \\pi^+ , \\pi^- you also find that charge conjugation is positive, but it’s not an eigenstate of the charge because acting with charge conjugation on \\pi^+ you get \\pi^- . Still we assign the charge conjugation. It’s convenient for many applications according to the charge conjugation of the neutral particle multiplet.\nIn order to find what are the charge conjugation, parity, and the spin, total spin for the combination of particles, you do the following:\n\nFirst you find the total J by doing the spin algebra.\nSecond, parity is multiplicative.\nThird, charge conjugation is multiplicative.\n\nFor L equals one, (-1)^L is the orbital angular momentum contribution to the parity that one has to add. The total parity for a composite system is P_{\\text{total}} = P_1 P_2 (-1)^L .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Formulas for Composite Systems\n\nTotal Parity: P_{\\text{total}} = P_1 P_2 (-1)^L , where P_1 and P_2 are the intrinsic parities of the constituent particles and L is their orbital angular momentum.\nTotal Angular Momentum: \\mathbf{J} = \\mathbf{L} + \\mathbf{S}_1 + \\mathbf{S}_2 , obtained via vector addition of spins and orbital angular momentum.\nCharge Conjugation for Neutral Mesons: C = (-1)^{L+S} , where S is the total spin of the quark-antiquark pair.\n\n\n\n\nI would like to give an example before you stop because it’s one of the most important skills I would like you to have: to be able to determine what are possible combinations of the spin and parity when you combine two particles. I’m going to draw the table that would list J^{PC} , J^P .\nFor the uncharged fermions, there is no charge conjugation, so I won’t have charge conjugation here. So J^P , for the combination of particles I start following out with the orbital angular momentum equals zero. I just combine spin and charge. In that case I have 1/2 , I add a 0, I get only 1/2 . The charge is multiplicative. Parity is multiplicative.\nI go to the first row adding 1 unit of angular momentum L = 1 . Then I go to the second row by adding 2 and the parity follows from the rule of (-1)^L .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: This figure schematically represents the excitation spectrum of a quantum system—such as the hydrogen atom or a hadron—organized by total angular momentum quantum number J and energy E . The horizontal axis shows J , the total angular momentum, while the vertical axis represents energy levels E . Each box indicates a particular quantum state characterized by its principal and orbital quantum numbers (such as 1S, 2S, 1P, 1D ) along with superscripts labeling the total spin/parity combinations (e.g., 1/2^+ , 1^+ , 3/2^- , 5/2^+ ). The figure illustrates how states with different total angular momentum (arising from combinations of orbital angular momentum L , spin S , and their Clebsch-Gordan addition) appear at distinct energy levels. For instance, the 1S state ( J=1/2^+ ) lies at the lowest energy, the 2S state ( J=1/2^+ ) at a higher energy, and the 1P multiplet splits into J=1/2^- and J=3/2^- , with the 1D state further splitting into J=3/2^+ and J=5/2^+ . Physically, this diagram encodes the spin algebra and angular momentum addition rules discussed in the lecture. The vertical structure reflects how energy depends on the excitation (principal quantum number and angular momentum), and the splitting along the J -axis exemplifies how spin and orbital angular momentum combine according to SU(2) symmetry and group theoretical rules. This is crucial for understanding the spectrum of composite systems (like hadrons or atoms) and for deducing possible quantum numbers for excited states in experimental spectroscopy.\n\n\n\nI start with 0, I run the angular momentum, it will be minus, minus, plus. That’s pretty much the excitation spectrum for Lambda baryons. I look at the Lambda baryon in the quark model. In the quark model means that now I consider my heavy quarks. There are no gluons any longer; they all condensate. Then quarks are heavy. Among these quarks there is a charm quark that’s heavy and it’s not part of our symmetry. There is u and d from the flavor consideration of the group can be in isospin 1, or it could be in isospin 0. That’s how we combine the isospin. This is a flavor part of the group.\nThere is a symmetry that holds for baryons. Since they are the same particle, u and d , as we agreed, they have to be in symmetric combination. If they are in isospin zero, they are entered antisymmetrically. So isospin zero is minus sign here. That’s why the spin combination must from the spin. They also have to be in the spin zero to have overall antisymmetry.\nI’m mixing up overall wave function for the baryon. Since the fermions have to be antisymmetrical, there is a color wave function that we might discuss at one point; it gives a minus sign. There is the spin wave functions. As we found out for the eta and for the… So S wave is symmetric. I’m missing a minus sign somewhere. This is the right answer. I’m missing a minus sign somewhere.\nThe isospin wave function is there. Then spin wave functions would be good corresponds to that spin, spin zero of the u and d . And that’s what.\nNow we can consider how this baryon is excited. We discussed already that one way of making different particles out of this guy is to interchange U and D. But since the \\Lambda_c is isospin zero, there are no other particles in this multiplet. It’s only one \\Lambda_c .\nThe other way to make different particles out of the \\Lambda_c is to excite the system. You can excite it radially, like the hydrogen atom, to make the object bigger. You probably remember the hydrogen atom. There is an n quantum number, the principal quantum number that tells you how big the system is. Essentially, what are the orbitals of the electron. You can do the same for \\Lambda_c . You can have 1s, 2s, and so on.\nThis one will be the ground state \\Lambda_c . This next one will be an excited, bigger \\Lambda_c . You would call it \\Lambda_c^{**} . I think we found this one. It’s pretty broad.\nYou can excite the system orbitally, putting orbital angular momentum between, let’s say, the ud pair and the heavy center of this sigma. That would correspond to the orbital excitations. Then it gives these one P \\Lambda_c states. We have found what the quantum numbers of these are.\nLooking at this, this would be the ground state of \\Lambda_c . These two are orbital excitations. It’s important to realize that when we do excitation of the system, we obtain different particles.\nIf you look at the PDG, you will see the names that we know of. We have discovered in experiments around seven different \\Lambda_c ’s. So the ground one, these two guys, these two guys, and this one, I think six. Then there is one high-end spectrum that we don’t know which multiplet it belongs to. These are, although listed as different particles, sort of excitations of the ground state \\Lambda_c ."

Learn how to construct this table—essentially, how to do spin algebra.\n\n9.1 Constructing the S Wave and Angular Momentum Addition\nWe start by constructing the S wave, where the orbital angular momentum L = 0 . Using Clebsch-Gordan coefficients is straightforward here. Adding one unit of angular momentum is also straightforward, but you must be careful not to mix up the procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen combining two systems with angular momenta j_1 and j_2 , the total angular momentum j can take values: j = |j_1 - j_2|, |j_1 - j_2| + 1, \\dots, j_1 + j_2\nThis is the Clebsch-Gordan series, fundamental for constructing spin wavefunctions and determining allowed states.\n\n\n\nIf you are already in an orbital angular momentum zero combination—and there are only a few of them—you must consider them separately. One combination spans several states, and another will span several different states.\nThe same procedure applies when you want to combine angular momenta in a decay.\n\n\n9.2 Applying This to a Particle Decay\nConsider the decay of a particle A : A \\to B + C\nWe know the quantum numbers:\n\nParticle A is 0^+\nParticle B is a vector, 1^-\nParticle C is 2^-\n\nWe can ask: What is the orbital angular momentum L in this decay? The decay is analyzed in the rest frame of particle A . Particle B goes in one direction, particle C goes in the opposite direction, defining a relative angle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a decay A \\to B + C , parity is conserved: P_A = P_B \\, P_C \\, (-1)^L\nwhere (-1)^L is the parity of the orbital state.\n\n\n\nIf you combine the two final-state particles in an S wave ( L = 0 ), the possible total spin-parity J^P is only 1^- . In a P wave ( L = 1 ), the parity would be positive. To reach the 2^- state, you need a D wave ( L = 2 ).\nTherefore, the partial wave for this decay is a D wave. I hope we get to practice this calculation—it’s very important.\n\n\n9.3 A Practice Problem: Hydrogen Atom in a Magnetic Field\nLet’s work on a problem. We have a hydrogen atom placed in a strong magnetic field. The task is to determine the excitation spectrum.\nConsider the following energy levels: 1s , 2s , 2p , 3s , 3p , 3d .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the hydrogen atom, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l is restricted by the principal quantum number n : l &lt; n\nThis is why, for n=3 , we have l = 0 (s), 1 (p), and 2 (d), but no f-wave ( l=3 ).\n\n\n\nWe will restrict ourselves to s, p, and d waves only, excluding the f-wave. This is a beautiful puzzle—you may have seen it before. It’s the same problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a strong magnetic field (Paschen-Back regime), the energy shift for a state with quantum numbers n, l, m_l, m_s is approximately: \\Delta E = \\mu_B B \\, (m_l + 2m_s)\nwhere \\mu_B is the Bohr magneton, B is the field strength, m_l is the orbital magnetic quantum number, and m_s = \\pm 1/2 is the spin projection.\n\n\n\nThe skill of constructing and using the spin-algebra table is something we want to practice more. I think we’re done, except for this problem."

    "text": "6 Applications and Homework\nWe will continue discussing angular distributions after the Dalitz plot. The homework exercise on Dalitz plots connects directly to hadron spectroscopy, which is the focus of upcoming lectures.\nKey realization: For any N-body process, once you specify the kinematic variables, you can completely reconstruct the “rigid body” configuration of all momentum vectors in the center-of-mass frame.\nThe recursive phase space formula demonstrates that the Jacobian for transformation to Mandelstam variables is constant, making these variables ideal for studying interaction dynamics through Dalitz plot analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A sketch illustrating the recursive relation when computing the phase-space expression. This is not a dynamic assumption but a mathematical trick that rewrites the full three-body phase-space through lower-dimensional phase-space elements and the two-body phase-space, for which the expression is simple.\n\n\n\n\n6.1 Decoding the Λc Dalitz Plot\nYou can see the example of the triple decay that I have here of the \\Lambda_c baryon going to the proton, kaon, and pion: \\Lambda_c^+ \\to p + K^- + \\pi^+\nWe measure \\Lambda_c produced in proton-proton collisions or any other collisions. In experiments, they observe \\Lambda_c abundantly. This is one of the particles that lives long enough and is produced copiously.\nParticles with charm ground states are produced abundantly and live sufficiently long to fly from the primary vertex. That’s why we have a good sample and a good understanding of their decay kinematics—not only kinematics, but dynamics as well. (see Figure~6)\nIn this decay, there is a charm quark in the initial state and no charm quark in the final state, indicating that this occurs via weak interaction. The charm quark disappears between initial and final states: the charm quark decays, transitioning into a strange quark that ends up in the kaon. This c \\to s transition happens within one generation and is not suppressed—it is an allowed process.\nThis decay is considered a golden channel for detection because:\n\nThe final state contains three charged particles—there are no neutrals.\nThe proton is charged, travels well, and is stable.\nThe kaon and pion are stable in our accelerator experiments.\n\nThese particles fly from the decay without distraction, and we see their tracks clearly through all detectors. They point away from the primary interaction vertex.\nThere is roughly a 1 cm shift between the primary vertex and the secondary vertex in \\Lambda_c decays. This displacement occurs due to the boost and the fact that \\Lambda_c lives longer in the laboratory frame than in its rest frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decay length in the laboratory frame is given by: L = \\beta\\gamma c\\tau At the LHC, \\Lambda_c is produced with energies of a few hundred GeV, making this decay particularly clean and well-suited for study.\n\n\n\nWe have studied this decay extensively. Here is the result of an analysis that resembles experimental data. If I showed you actual experimental data, you wouldn’t distinguish it from this plot—the statistics are so high that the distribution appears very smooth.\n\nOn the x-axis: invariant mass of the proton and kaon, m_{12}^2\nOn the y-axis: invariant mass of the kaon and pion, m_{23}^2\n\nAll allowed kinematic values for the decay are shown in color. (see Figure~6) The white area corresponds to kinematics where no physical configuration exists—energy and momentum cannot be conserved there.\nIf you select a point inside the colored region, you can compute angles between particles and reproduce the configuration with a 3D-printed rigid body. But if you choose a point in the white region, you quickly find that energy conservation cannot be satisfied.\nThe range of possible values for the invariant masses is limited, and this surface is called the Dalitz plot. The kinematic boundaries are defined by:\nm_{12}^2 + m_{23}^2 + m_{13}^2 = m_{\\Lambda_c}^2 + m_p^2 + m_K^2 + m_{\\pi}^2\nDifferent colors in the plot indicate different probabilities for the decay to occur at that kinematic point. (see Figure~6) The differential decay rate in the Dalitz plot is:\n\\frac{d^2\\Gamma}{dm_{12}^2  dm_{23}^2} \\propto |\\mathcal{M}|^2\nWe measure the decay by reconstructing particle tracks and identifying from which kinematic point the decay originated. There is an unambiguous relation between four-vectors and kinematic points. (see Figure~3)\nIt turns out that certain kinematics are more probable than others—particles prefer specific directions. For example, one configuration may be more common, while another is rare. On the border of the Dalitz plot, particles are aligned in one line, whereas inside the surface they always have an angle between them.\nThink about how to maximize the invariant mass and where on the border such a point lies.\n\n\n6.2 Dalitz Plot Kinematics in Three-Body Decay\nLet’s consider the three-body decay \\Lambda_c^+ \\to pK^-\\pi^+ and its kinematics. (see Figure~1) We want to maximize the invariant mass of the proton–Kaon system. (see Figure~6)\nThere are three outgoing momenta. The idea is that if the three momenta are arranged in opposite directions, the total three-momentum sum should be as small as possible. (see Figure~6)\nIf we add both momentum vectors, the forward momentum—or more precisely, the magnitude of the sum of the momentum vectors—should be as large as possible. Therefore, we should be on the right side of the Dalitz plot diagram.\nNow, consider the mass on the y-axis: should it be as large or as small as possible? (see Figure~3) It should be as small as possible.\nWhy? Because when the three momenta are collinear and we subtract them appropriately, the invariant mass is minimized.\nOne way to think about this is to go to the rest frame of the Kaon and pion. If they are flying nearly together, their relative momentum is small. In their mutual rest frame, they could both be at rest, so their invariant mass would simply be the sum of their rest masses—this is the minimum possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe minimum invariant mass for any two-particle system is given by M_{ij}^{\\text{min}} = m_i + m_j This occurs when the two particles are at rest relative to each other.\n\n\n\nYou are correct: we are looking for the minimal invariant mass of the proton–Kaon system.\nLet’s identify what this point corresponds to kinematically. In certain configurations, two particles can be nearly at rest while the third carries away the momentum. (see Figure~6) That corresponds to the minimal invariant mass case.\nThis plot is likely from experimental data. How would we reconstruct such an event experimentally if we don’t detect the proton directly? Even though measurements occur in the lab frame (which is boosted), the analysis is often performed in the center-of-mass frame.\nThe point of maximum invariant mass occurs when the two particles move back-to-back with maximum momentum. The point we are discussing minimizes the invariant mass.\nFor three-body decays, there is a similar way to define angular variables. (see Figure~1) Let me briefly mention this.\nI will boost into the rest frame for each kinematic setup. To clarify, I am referring to the proton, Kaon, and pion. Suppose I fix the invariant mass of the proton–Kaon system.\nThe approach is to work in the center-of-momentum frame of the \\Lambda_c, where the three final-state particles have momenta summing to zero. Then, I boost to the rest frame of the Kaon and pion. (see Figure~6) In that frame, the Kaon and pion have equal and opposite momenta. (see Figure~7)\nIf I fix the invariant mass of the proton–Kaon system and explore phase space along a line where that mass is fixed, the magnitudes of the momenta are fixed—only the angle \\theta changes.\nAs \\theta varies from 0 to \\pi, one extreme (\\theta = 0) corresponds to the proton and Kaon moving in the same direction, yielding a small invariant mass. The other extreme (\\theta = \\pi) corresponds to them moving oppositely, giving the maximum invariant mass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe invariant mass squared for two particles is M_{ij}^2 = (p_i + p_j)^2 = (E_i + E_j)^2 - (\\vec{p}_i + \\vec{p}_j)^2 This quantity is Lorentz invariant and is used to define Dalitz plot axes.\n\n\n\nFor angle \\theta = 0, the invariant mass is small. As the angle increases, the invariant mass grows. The same logic applies to the other pairings.\nA straightforward analysis method is to go to the rest frame of the proton–Kaon system, where all quantities are fixed, and scan by changing the angle between the proton and Kaon relative to the pion direction. (see Figure~6)\nThus, lines in the Dalitz plot represent configurations where the angle is varied in some rest frame.\nAnother variable in 2 \\to 2 scattering kinematics is the U variable, which offers a more symmetric treatment. For three-body decays, we also have the invariant mass of the pion–proton system.\nIf I fix the invariant mass of the proton–Kaon system and scan the angle, which line do I move along? This follows from the relation that the U variable is a linear combination of the invariant masses.\nIn fact, the coefficients are such that the motion corresponds to a diagonal in the Dalitz plot. This line represents a fixed pion–proton invariant mass, moving from one kinematic endpoint to the other.\nThe standard representation in experimental analyses uses Dalitz plots with the x-axis as the invariant mass squared of one pair and the y-axis as the invariant mass squared of another pair—exactly what is shown here.\nIn homework, you may encounter a more symmetric Dalitz plot where all variables enter symmetrically. This uses the geometry of an equilateral triangle, where every point inside satisfies a conservation relation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the symmetric representation, the coordinates are x = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(M_{12}^2 - M_{23}^2), \\quad y = M_{13}^2 - \\frac{1}{2}(M_{12}^2 + M_{23}^2) The factor \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} arises from the 60° angles in an equilateral triangle.\n\n\n\nIf you sum the perpendicular distances from any interior point to the three sides of an equilateral triangle, the total is constant. This allows us to define symmetric variables representing the sum of the invariant masses.\nThe variables are interpreted as distances to the sides. This gives a very symmetric and elegant representation.\nEssentially, this is equivalent to the standard plot—they are related by a linear transformation, not just a rotation but also a skew. To plot experimental data in this form, one must apply the correct coordinate transformation.\nYesterday, I worked through the algebra relating Cartesian coordinates to the heights in the triangle—it’s straightforward but interesting.\nThis symmetric representation is nice, while the standard one is more common and easier to plot directly. Both capture the same kinematics.\nIn the Dalitz plot, regions with higher event density indicate kinematic enhancements. The purpose of this kinematic representation is to identify the dynamics and underlying processes governing the decay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A kinematic representation of the transition from the initial state to the final state in the process where particle 0 decays into particle x and particle 3. The arrows indicate the three-momenta of particles 3 and x, and the fat dot marks particle 0, which is at rest in this frame.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, we will see that \\Lambda_c decay to three particles often proceeds via intermediate resonances. Temporarily, two particles form a resonant state that then decays, increasing the decay rate in certain invariant mass regions.\nWhen the energy of two particles matches a resonance, their interaction is stronger, making the decay more probable. This is why we observe enhanced densities along certain bands in the Dalitz plot.\n\n\n6.3 Resonance Structures and Angular Distributions in Three-Body Decays\nYou might have seen cross sections for two-particle resonances. These exhibit a characteristic bump known as a hadronic resonance. The underlying physics is that when you have a system of two particles, and the quantum numbers of that system match those of an intermediate resonance, the interaction probability increases dramatically at specific energies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Breit-Wigner resonance cross section describes this enhancement: \n\\sigma(E) \\propto \\frac{\\Gamma^2/4}{(E - E_R)^2 + \\Gamma^2/4}\n where E_R is the resonance energy and \\Gamma is the resonance width.\n\n\n\nBy adjusting the system energy, you explore how likely two particles are to interact. When passing through the resonance region, the probability increases significantly. This creates bent structures in the Dalitz distribution—when projected onto one axis, you see the characteristic resonance shape.\nThis example is particularly interesting because it shows resonances in all three particle pairs:\n\nHorizontal lines correspond to fixed K\\pi mass → K^* resonances\nVertical lines correspond to fixed proton-K\\pi mass → K-nucleon resonances\nDiagonal lines correspond to pion-proton combinations → \\Delta resonances\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dalitz plot density for three-body decays is: \n\\frac{d^2\\Gamma}{dm_{12}^2  dm_{23}^2} = \\text{constant} \\times |\\mathcal{M}|^2\n where m_{ij} are invariant masses and \\mathcal{M} is the decay amplitude. (see Figure~1)\n\n\n\nThe lines appear parallel to the sides of the Dalitz triangle:\n\nK^* resonances parallel to one side\n\\Lambda resonances parallel to another side\n\\Delta resonances parallel to the third side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The Dalitz plot, a representation of the phase-space for the three-body decay. (see Figure~6) It appears as an ellipse-shaped area where the internal region corresponds to allowed kinematics and the outside region is forbidden. On the x-axis lies the squared mass of two final-state particles, while the y-axis corresponds to the other subsystem. A horizontal line represents a slice of the phase-space with one mass fixed. The borders of the area correspond to configurations where all three momenta are aligned in the rest frame of the decaying particle, or equivalently, where the scattering angle in the relevant rest frame is either 0 or π.\n\n\n\nNow let’s examine angular distributions within resonance bands. When traversing phase space while keeping the mass combination fixed, you’re effectively changing the decay angle. This angle dependence reveals important physics:\n\nWithin a resonance band, probability can be inhomogeneous\nParticles often prefer aligned vs. perpendicular configurations\nThese preferences occur because intermediate resonances have spin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAngular distributions are powerful tools for measuring:\n\nSpin\nParity\nOther quantum numbers\n\n\n\n\nKey observations:\n\nHigher spin particles produce more structured angular distributions\nScalar particles produce no angular asymmetries\nThe number of nodes in angular distribution often equals the spin value\nFor spin-J particles: N_{\\text{states}} = 2J + 1 spin projections\n\nWhen dealing with particle spins, we need to understand how quantum states transform under rotations. For a particle with spin J, there are 2J+1 possible projections along a quantization axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wigner D-function describes rotations using Euler angles (\\phi, \\theta, \\gamma): \nD^J_{m'm}(\\phi, \\theta, \\gamma) = e^{-i m' \\phi}  d^J_{m'm}(\\theta)  e^{-i m \\gamma}\n where d^J_{m'm}(\\theta) is the Wigner small d-matrix.\n\n\n\nRotation conventions in particle physics: 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: A diagram showing the spin projection.

The representation is drawn in the rest frame of particle x, shown as a dot at rest, with arrows representing the three-momenta of particles 1 and 2 in this frame.\n\n\n\nThis separation makes angular analysis a powerful model-independent tool for determining particle properties.\n\n\n6.4 Angular Distributions and Partial Wave Analysis\nHow many numbers do I need in order to compute electromagnetic interactions or gravity? Specifically, to predict the angular distribution, what input parameters are required? The current framework appears to miss some fundamental components.\nWhat is inside these interaction vertices or amplitude blocks? To predict all observable values, I need the transition amplitudes for different spin configurations.\nThe number of independent amplitudes is given by the spin degeneracy factor: (2j_1 + 1)(2j_2 + 1) where j_1 and j_2 are the spins of the particles involved. These amplitude values might also be functions of particle masses, particularly the masses of the intermediate states.\nA similar number of parameters is needed for the final state amplitudes, but there are reasonable approximation methods available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn experimental analysis, we often make the initial assumption that these amplitude coefficients are constant, representing fundamental particle properties rather than dynamic functions. This simplification allows us to compute angular distributions without knowing the detailed internal dynamics.\n\n\n\nWith this constant amplitude assumption, I can compute the angular distribution while fixing the mass parameters and intensity normalization.\nThe differential decay rate with respect to \\cos\\theta is given by: \\frac{d\\Gamma}{d\\cos\\theta} \\propto |\\mathcal{M}|^2\nUsing \\cos\\theta rather than \\theta itself is preferable because it has a simpler Jacobian—we avoid the \\sin\\theta factor that appears in the \\theta distribution. The matrix element squared |\\mathcal{M}|^2 is typically treated as constant in this approximation.\nThe angular distribution spans from \\cos\\theta = -1 to \\cos\\theta = 1:\n\nA flat distribution indicates isotropic decay\nFor particles with spin, we often observe parabolic distributions (second-order polynomials in \\cos\\theta)\nOther characteristic patterns may appear depending on the spin structure\n\nIt’s crucial to recognize that A represents the quantum transition amplitude—a complex-valued quantity that gets squared to give the observed probability. In experiments, we only measure the squared magnitude of amplitudes.\nFor unpolarized decays, the distributions are averaged over initial spin projections and summed over final spin projections: \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} \\propto \\frac{1}{(2s_1+1)(2s_2+1)} \\sum_{\\text{spins}} |\\mathcal{M}|^2\nWhen analyzing experimental data, we don’t initially guess the amplitude form directly.

I’m skipping the explicit summation over \\mu from 1 to 4, and also over \\nu, which also appears twice.\nNow, F_{\\mu\\nu} is actually a matrix: \\mu is 4-dimensional and \\nu is 4-dimensional, so F_{\\mu\\nu} is a 4 \\times 4 matrix.\nYou don’t multiply matrices as usual; you multiply them component-wise.

    "section": "8 Gauge Transformations",
    "text": "8 Gauge Transformations\nGo to the next portion — the Rancho Kinemic picture.\nWhile I’m cleaning the board, let me ask questions about this point.\nWe discussed the Lagrangian and equations of motion. Let’s discuss gauge transformation and gauge symmetry — an extremely important concept in field theory.\nWe’ll only touch on this briefly since we’re not doing field theory, but it’s really important you know where legs grow from it.\nSomething very familiar from quantum mechanics is the phase ambiguity of the wave function. We can update the phase, and the absolute square of the wave function won’t change because you multiply \\psi to \\psi^* and the phase drops out.\nThis is fine. First is to acknowledge that this should be a symmetry of our theory — we should be allowed to make this phase transformation.\nIt’s kind of by definition, so this overall phase you don’t even have to think about.\nThe problem appears when you demand your theory to be invariant under changes of phase at all possible space-time points simultaneously with different phases.\nWhat if I want to adjust my wave function at every space point?\nWhy is this a problem? Because in our equation of motion, in our Lagrangian — let me just write the Dirac part: \\bar{\\psi}D_\\mu\\gamma^\\mu\\psi.\nHere I have a term \\partial_\\mu\\psi, and this term becomes \\partial_\\mu\\psi' which is \\partial_\\mu(e^{i\\alpha(x)}\\psi).\nLet me take the derivative. This equals applying the derivative to the first term and then to the second term.\nWhen I apply it to the second term, I just have \\partial_\\mu\\psi. When I apply it to the first term, I get \\partial_\\mu acting on this — the exponent stays, but I have to take the derivative of the exponent.\nSo there’s an extra term. Indeed, the same equation won’t hold for \\psi'. It doesn’t transform to the same equation because the derivative yields another term with \\partial_\\mu\\alpha.\nThis means that local gauge transformation is not a symmetry of the free Lagrangian of the free moving Dirac particle.\nYou cannot adjust phase independently at different points for a free particle.\nIn simple words, this means the theory is incomplete. It only becomes complete if you consider radiation, photons, and charged particles together.\nOnce you look at the full Lagrangian (I think I get a minus here — that’s an exercise in field theory), you update simultaneously the phase of the field \\psi and the electromagnetic field A.\nThen you see that the additional term appearing in the covariant derivative D_\\mu will cancel exactly the one you get from the phase.\nThen the Lagrangian stays the same with the updated fields \\psi and A.\nThis fact led us to the D_\\mu term. Actually, writing D_\\mu minus or plus — was it plus before or minus? That’s correct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe covariant derivative in QED is: D_\\mu = \\partial_\\mu - ieA_\\mu This ensures local U(1) gauge invariance by canceling the extra terms from phase transformations, with e being the electromagnetic coupling constant."

They have to interact with strength g.\nThe structure is very simple. Again, this is a scalar quantity.\nYou can figure out and convince yourself that the same integral is a scalar quantity.

    "section": "10 Extending to Other Theories",
    "text": "10 Extending to Other Theories\nNow we’ll take this idea and move from QED to QCD.\nBefore jumping to QCD, where we deal with wave functions in three dimensions, let’s consider wave functions in the space of two coordinates — the case for weak interaction.\nFor weak interaction, you have up components and down components. Remember how the weak charge for quarks was +1/2 or -1/2 — the same range.\nHere you have an up field and down field. Remember, it’s still a fermion, so they have hidden four spinor components (we don’t talk about that).\nIn that case, the transformation that updates the phase is more general.\nWhat we want is that the update happening here doesn’t change the observable. Our observable will be \\psi^\\dagger\\psi.\nG or the matrix that updates the field — \\psi is the 2 \\times 2 matrix, and it’s unitary because observables should not change.\nIn this case, we’re dealing with transformations that are unitary, described by unitary matrices spanning the class called the U(2) group.\nWe’ll also fix the determinant of this matrix to be 1, and then this S comes from — for all matrices with determinant equal to 1 and unitary, they can be represented as an exponent.\nWho has seen the exponent of a matrix before? If you saw, what is this? Can you tell me what I should write here and then V?\nThis is more complicated. As soon as I put here one, it gets a little bit…\nWe solved it last year, right? I think it’s either 1 or 1 - e something. So e to 1, 1, 10 gets more complicated.\n\n10.1 Matrix Exponentiation and Generators in SU(N) Groups\nExactly right. So the approach is to take the expansion and perform multiple matrix multiplications.\nI recall it’s either e^{1} or 1 - e, but here, this is certainly not zero — and in fact, I’m not entirely sure about that anyway — so you understand what I’m referring to.\nThis is matrix exponentiation, and you can represent any element of the SU(2) group using matrix exponentiation. Here, we have a 2 \\times 2 matrix with zero trace. That condition comes from the determinant: \n\\det(U) = e^{\\mathrm{Tr}(\\alpha)} = 1\n which implies the trace of \\alpha must be zero.\nIn fact, there are only three matrices that span the entire basis of such traceless matrices: the Pauli matrices. These are called the generators of the group because they generate any group element.\nOnce we identify these three generators, we can take any three real numbers \\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, compute the combination -i\\alpha_j \\sigma_j, exponentiate it, and obtain an element of SU(2) — and in fact, this spans the entire group. You need to know the generator matrices — they’re fixed — then provide three numbers, and I can plug them into a Python routine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny element of SU(2) can be written as: \nU = e^{-i \\alpha_j \\sigma_j}\n where \\sigma_j are the Pauli matrices and \\alpha_j are real parameters.\n\n\n\nIs there a reason we fix the determinant to 1? Yes — because we’re working with SU(2). In general, \nU(N) = U(1) \\times SU(N)\n So U(2) is U(1) × SU(2). The U(1) part is just a simple scalar phase, while SU(2) contains the non-trivial matrix structure. The scalar phase behaves exactly as in the 2D case, but the SU(2) matrix gives something interesting.\nSo I see the relationship, but why do we fix the determinant? Because SU(2) is one of the standard groups — we know a lot about it. If we considered U(2) instead, we’d have more generators and greater complexity. SU(2) is one of the primary elementary groups — that’s the main reason. We know everything about SU(2): how many generators it has, its matrix structure — it’s a nice object to work with.\nThis factorization helps us proceed similarly for higher groups: \nU(3) = U(1) \\times SU(3)\n We factor out the phase, and what remains is the standard group SU(3), which we use to describe the global update of the wave function with the same components. This is exactly what we deal with in quantum chromodynamics (QCD).\nWhen dealing with color charge, we don’t have two components — we have three: red, blue, and green. The transformation is then a 3 \\times 3 matrix with an overall phase — that’s not too complicated. We’ve discussed this before.\nBut then there’s a non-trivial contribution where you update your fields significantly. These are 3 \\times 3 matrices with determinant equal to 1. Again, you can relate this to the matrix exponential, and the exponent must be traceless.\nThe basis of traceless matrices in three dimensions that satisfy the anti-commutation properties — should I say the output must be anti-Hermitian? Does it hold for our condition? We insert it, multiply by two, and get -i\\alpha, then move to the other part.\nIf you look at the basis in two dimensions for traceless matrices, you get three generators; in three dimensions, you get eight. The number of generators is related to the number of charge carriers in the field.\nIn fact, we identify each generator matrix with the action of the field because they appear in the interaction term. The interaction term includes this matrix: every time you attach the field \\psi and the interaction field A, it comes together with this generator matrix.\nTo connect this back: remember where this chunk came from? We were computing derivatives and found an extra derivative for the phase. This extra derivative led us to introduce an extended derivative of the field — an interaction term that appears in Feynman diagrams.\nAs soon as we deal with higher dimensions, the same derivative we compute will come together with the appropriate matrix. So \\alpha is now 2 \\times 2, and it will appear here as another matrix. These generator matrices — \\sigma for SU(2), or \\lambda for SU(3) — will appear in the interaction vertex.\nWe find that:\n\nFor SU(2): 3 generators → 3 charge carriers: Z, W^+, W^-\nFor SU(3): 8 generators → 8 gluons\n\nUnfortunately, we lack the imagination to name all eight gluons properly, but they are identified by their matrices.\nIn the case of weak interaction, one matrix is diagonal in the space — roughly corresponding to the Z boson. The W and Z are charged similarly to the gluon field; some will be diagonal, and we identify certain extra hypercharges for the states. Some will behave like W_2, W^+, depending on the matrix.\nYou’ll see the same matrices in homework exercises. Think of them as the eight different gluons — you can name them, and they act differently on the field. They appear in the interaction vertex depending on the flavor of the gluon interacting with the quark. Each vertex behaves differently, driven by the structure of the Pauli matrices or their generalizations.\nThat’s why it’s a good exercise to think about this interaction term: How does this become a skewer? How do we contract the color charge? It’s a big, old puzzle.\nNow, the last part: I have two more topics. Confinement is important to discuss, so let me say a few words about it, and then we’ll go through the basic equations quickly.\nConfinement is the property of the theory where the strong interaction grows with distance. Unlike electromagnetic interactions, which decrease with distance, the strong interaction governing color charge increases when you pull quarks apart. This confines quarks to small scales.\nThe only way to feel the strong interaction is to zoom in to the smallest objects: mesons and baryons. Let’s draw them again:\n\nThis is a meson\nThis is a baryon\n\nThe word “confined” means that the strong interaction exists only inside the bubble of the meson or baryon. There is no strong interaction outside. If you try to pull them apart with huge force, at some point they divide — but then the resulting objects are again color-neutral, confined, and travel as stable particles.\nColor neutral means having zero charge with respect to the strong interaction. Remember: as soon as a particle has color charge, gluons can interact with it — meaning it’s not confined. Therefore, matter forms into these little bubbles where strong interactions are active inside, but outside they don’t feel the strong field — they are color neutral.\nI’m not deriving this — I’m stating it as a fact of the theory, proven by the existence of life as we know it. Confinement plays a vital role in binding and making life possible.\nHowever, if you look at the Lagrangian — where did our Lagrangian go? — you can’t directly see that it’s a confined theory. There are indications of confinement in the Lagrangian, and one of them is the gluon self-interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Diagrams of gluon self-interactions arising from the gauge part of the Lagrangian. These illustrate the non-Abelian nature of QCD and provide the basis for color confinement.\n\n\n\nIn QED, we had photon terms; in QCD, we have G_\\mu terms like: \nG_\\mu G_\\nu - G_\\nu G_\\mu + f^{abc} G_\\nu G_\\nu\n and then G_\\mu G_\\mu with 3-gluon and 4-gluon terms. These manifest in interaction vertices like this and this — called gluon self-interactions.\nGluon self-interaction is one indication of confinement — not a proof, but a clue. People study all possible field theories; some have confinement, some don’t. Confinement remains one of the great unsolved problems — there’s even a prize waiting for whoever can explain it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe running coupling \\alpha_s(Q) depends on the momentum transfer Q:\n\nAsymptotic freedom: \\alpha_s(Q) \\to 0 as Q \\to \\infty\nConfinement: \\alpha_s(Q) grows large at low Q (around 1 GeV)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Running of the strong coupling \\alpha_s(Q) with momentum transfer Q. At high Q, the coupling decreases, showing asymptotic freedom; at low Q \\lesssim 1 GeV, the coupling grows large, marking the confinement region.\n\n\n\nWe define Q as the momentum with which we probe the hadron. What we experience is the effective strong coupling \\alpha_s^{\\text{eff}}. You can think of a gluon coming in, interacting with a quark, and a lot happening — effectively, one quantum bubble with an effective interaction strength that depends on the gluon’s momentum.\nThis gluon, depending on its energy, will experience different interaction strengths. In electromagnetic interactions, we discuss screening effects; here, the effective interaction depends on Q as follows:\n\nIf Q is very high, we’re in the regime of asymptotic freedom\nIf Q is low, we’re in the regime of confinement\n\nThe transition happens around 1 GeV. Hadrons live in the low-Q region.\nIf you think about it: these particles talk to each other, exchange gluons, and the gluon couples to the fermion. When they’re close together, the gluon momentum is small — below 1 GeV — and that’s where the interaction is super strong. Meanwhile, at very high momentum transfer, the coupling becomes small — that’s asymptotic freedom, which we’ll discuss more later.\n\n\n10.2 Nuclear Binding and Decay Fundamentals\nI notice you’ve provided detailed instructions and examples for editing lecture transcripts, but you haven’t included the actual nuclear physics lecture transcription that needs to be polished.\nThe helping material contains several relevant nuclear physics formulas that could be integrated if they appear in your transcript:\nKey Nuclear Physics Formulas:\n\nNuclear Binding Energy: Calculates the energy equivalent of the mass defect: B(Z,A) = [Zm_p + (A-Z)m_n - m_{\\text{nucleus}}]c^2\nSemi-Empirical Mass Formula: Approximates binding energy based on the liquid drop model: B(Z,A) = a_V A - a_S A^{2/3} - a_C \\frac{Z(Z-1)}{A^{1/3}} - a_A \\frac{(A-2Z)^2}{A} + \\delta(A,Z)\nRadioactive Decay Law: Follows exponential decay: N(t) = N_0e^{-\\lambda t}\nRutherford Scattering: Describes angular distribution: \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\left(\\frac{Z_1Z_2e^2}{8\\pi\\epsilon_0E}\\right)^2 \\frac{1}{\\sin^4(\\theta/2)}\nUniverse Evolution Timeline: Includes key phases:\nt \\sim 10^{-12} seconds: Quark-Gluon Plasma\nt \\sim 1 second: Big Bang nucleosynthesis begins\nQuark Charge Properties:\nUp-type quarks (u, c, t): Electric charge +\\frac{2}{3}\nDown-type quarks (d, s, b): Electric charge -\\frac{1}{3}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese formulas represent fundamental concepts in nuclear and particle physics that might appear in your lecture transcript.

I will walk you a little bit through the history of how important discoveries were made and what we learned from there about the hadrons and how we can group them together.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, there were a lot of new big accelerators built, like for example the Bevatron. It came into operation in 1954. It was a proton accelerator with energies of up to 13 GeV. These high energy protons were then shot at a fixed target, and a lot of different particles were produced and detected. They found over 100 new particles, which was then called the particle zoo. Physicists of the time had to think about how to organize these particles: is there some pattern? Are these all fundamental particles? This is what we will be talking about today.\nIf you think about the periodic table, for example, we had all these atoms and we were able to group them together according to their proton and neutron numbers. We knew how many electrons were in the outermost shells, which helped us to group them together in the periodic table. This is kind of what we want to do now with hadrons. In the context of particle physics or hadron physics, the characteristics that we choose to group them together are according to their quantum numbers. We will now discuss different quantum numbers and why they were introduced and how they helped us to group together certain particles.\n\n1.1 Isospin Introduction\nLet’s start with isospin. In 1932 the neutron was discovered, and different experiments showed that when we look into proton-proton interactions, proton-neutron interactions, or neutron-neutron interactions, they had a very similar interaction strength. If you look at the rate at which these interactions were taking place, then they were basically the same. Experiments showed that all of these had similar interaction strength. If you also look at the mass of the proton and neutron, it’s almost the same at 939 MeV. This led to the suggestion that we can consider proton and neutron to be the same particle, but to have two different states that it can occur in, described by the isospin.\nThis means that the strong interaction does not distinguish between proton and neutron. The only time when we know that there are different particles is in an electromagnetic field. We can describe them as the same particle, the nucleon, and put them into an isospin doublet:\nN = \\begin{pmatrix} p \\\\ n \\end{pmatrix}\nThis is an analog property like the spin: if you look at the electron, we can have either spin up or spin down. This is similar here. At the level of quarks, since protons and neutrons are composed of up and down quarks, this means that the strong interaction does not distinguish between up and down.\nThe strong interaction is not capable of distinguishing between the different flavors of down and up. We can write that the up quark has an isospin of I = \\frac{1}{2} with the third component I_3(u) = +\\frac{1}{2}, and the down quark with I_3(d) = -\\frac{1}{2}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe isospin quantum numbers for quarks are:\n\nUp quark: I_3(u) = +\\frac{1}{2}\nDown quark: I_3(d) = -\\frac{1}{2} For antiquarks, the signs are reversed: I_3(\\bar{u}) = -\\frac{1}{2} and I_3(\\bar{d}) = +\\frac{1}{2} to maintain consistent SU(2) transformation properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Mathematical Framework of Isospin\nIsospin is not exactly a property like the spin, but mathematically we can treat the isospin like the spin. It follows the SU(2) algebra. In the last lecture, you already heard a little bit about the SU(2) algebras. Let me remind you a couple of things. It holds for the matrices, and we can describe this as a rotation matrix. Here, these sigma matrices are just the Pauli matrices. For the isospin operator, it was the same as for the spin where you had J instead of an I.\nGenerally we write these states always with the isospin and then the third component: |I, I_3 \\rangle. If we apply, for example, the I_3 operator to up, then we just get the eigenvalue +\\frac{1}{2}. We have here the lowering operators. If you have the isospin I, then we can have different projections I_3 from I down to -I, so you have 2I + 1 projections. With these lowering operators, you can go from one projection to the next. If you apply this to a state, you get out the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\nThis is just to remind you how this SU(2) algebra works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SU(2) isospin algebra follows these key relations:\n\nCommutation relations: [I_i, I_j] = i\\epsilon_{ijk}I_k\nLadder operators: I_\\pm = I_1 \\pm iI_2\nCasimir operator: I^2|I,I_3\\rangle = I(I+1)|I,I_3\\rangle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Meson Isospin Combinations\nNow let’s look at a couple of examples. For example, if you want to think about the up and down quarks: last time you heard that we can form mesons taking a quark and an antiquark. Let’s think about what kind of particles we can get if you combine up and down quarks with antiquarks for the mesons.\nIf you look here at the isospin, we have for both up and down quarks isospin \\frac{1}{2}. We combine \\frac{1}{2} with another \\frac{1}{2}. What can we get if we have two \\frac{1}{2} isospin particles? We can have isospin of 0 or 1, just like you’re used to in the spin. If you think about the dimensions here, we always have two projections for one half: +\\frac{1}{2} or -\\frac{1}{2}. This is the dimensions here: 2 \\times 2. To indicate that we have here an antiquark, I place this bar here on top.\nIf you have an isospin of 1, how many projections can we have for I_3? You can have 2I + 1 projections. For I = 1, you get three: +1, 0, -1. For I = 0, just zero. If you take these as dimensions, then you would get 3 + 1. This is how you would write it down according to group theory:\n\\mathbf{2} \\otimes \\mathbf{\\bar{2}} = \\mathbf{3} \\oplus \\mathbf{1}\nI will also discuss a little bit later how we can understand this in terms of matrices. Here basically you have a 4 \\times 4 matrix and then you can decompose it into two components: into a 3 \\times 3 and a 1 \\times 1 matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Excerpt of a Clebsch–Gordan coefficient table for the spin combination of 1/2 and 1/2. The table lists the coefficients used to couple two spin-1/2 particles into total spin states, showing how individual spin components combine to form singlet and triplet configurations.\n\n\n\nThis is a triplet isospin state and this is an isospin singlet. This is how these different states would look like written down in terms of up and down quarks and form mesons.\nNow I want to briefly discuss with you where these factors come from. Like in the case of spins, you can use Clebsch-Gordan coefficients if you combine two spins or two isospins to figure out what kind of signs and coefficients you have in front of them. I will just write down a small fraction of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. We are combining here either spin \\frac{1}{2} with \\frac{1}{2}. These are the isospins of the two particles that we want to combine, and these are then the projections, the I_3 components.\nI will write the one now on top. Here you can see the outcome: the new particles that you get out and below it you see the projection I_3 of this combination. We said we can have an isospin triplet with isospin 1, so we get here this one three times with the projection +1, 0, -1. We have here the singlet with zero and the projection zero. Then here we can see the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, and you also have to always take the square root. If you now look here, you can then see why these states look the way they do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe explicit wavefunctions for the pion triplet members are:\n\n|\\pi^+\\rangle = -|u\\bar{d}\\rangle\n|\\pi^0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|u\\bar{u}\\rangle - |d\\bar{d}\\rangle)\n|\\pi^-\\rangle = |d\\bar{u}\\rangle These come from Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining isospin-1/2 states.\n\n\n\n\nJust one more thing that I need to mention is that for the antiquarks we get I_3(\\bar{u}) = -\\frac{1}{2} and I_3(\\bar{d}) = +\\frac{1}{2}. This minus sign is chosen so the quarks and antiquarks behave in the same way when you apply SU(2) transformations. If you look here at the singlet, we get then from the up and anti-up we get this vector: we have these projections +\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}, so we get this vector with the square root. You do the same for down anti-down: you have -\\frac{1}{2}, +\\frac{1}{2}, you get here this minus sign, but because there’s also here this minus sign, it ends up being a plus. Then you do the same with the triplet one states. I just wanted to show you how it’s done, because we also practice this a lot more in the exercises.\nNow let’s take a step forward. I also wanted to mention what kind of particles we have here. This triplet typically pions: this would be a \\pi^+, this would be a \\pi^0, and here \\pi^-. We can also have rho particles: they’re basically the same, but there’s one thing that distinguishes these two, and that’s their spin. Here we have antiparallel spin, spin zero, and here they have parallel spin, but otherwise they’re the same. For the singlets we can have here an omega and here eta prime. Choosing this isospin quantum number, we can already group together some particles.\n\n\n1.4 Meson-Nucleon Systems and Baryons\nLet’s now go one step further and think about if you take for example a pion beam and shoot it on a proton target. We have a pion with isospin 1 and a nucleon target with isospin \\frac{1}{2}. What kind of isospin states can you get out of this? If you combine isospin 1 and isospin \\frac{1}{2}, you add this up. What do you guess? It’s either \\frac{3}{2} or \\frac{1}{2}.\nLet me write this properly. What are the dimensions here? For I = 1, we know it’s three: we have three different projections that are possible. For I = \\frac{1}{2}, we have two projections. Here we get four because we have \\pm\\frac{3}{2} and \\pm\\frac{1}{2}, and we get two again for \\frac{1}{2}. This is how you write this theory:\n\\mathbf{3} \\otimes \\mathbf{2} = \\mathbf{4} \\oplus \\mathbf{2}\nI also wanted to mention what this actually means, what we’re writing down. Basically we have here a 6 \\times 6 matrix and we can decompose it into matrices of the subspaces here: we have here a 2 \\times 2 matrix and here a 4 \\times 4 matrix. These are then called irreducible representations. This is basically what we do. For small numbers it’s kind of easy to know and write it down, but if you have larger numbers, there are some methods how you can figure this out. We will not discuss it in more depth, but I just wanted to mention what this actually means.\nIf you have isospin in SU(2), you get these four projections. This can be actually assigned to particles that were found at the time: these are called delta particles. We have \\Delta^{++}, \\Delta^+, \\Delta^0, \\Delta^-. They also give you the mass m_\\Delta = 1232\\text{ MeV}.\nI want to do one last example. Right now we have looked into meson systems and combining a meson and a nucleon system. What about if you just combine three quarks to get baryons? Then you would have basically 2 \\times 2 \\times 2: three quarks, and there are always two projections possible for \\pm\\frac{1}{2}. We can now use what we have already seen here: 2 \\times 2 gives us 3 + 1. This is what we had before: \\mathbf{2} \\otimes \\mathbf{2} \\otimes \\mathbf{2} = \\mathbf{4} \\oplus \\mathbf{2} \\oplus \\mathbf{2}. This gives us four, eight: \\frac{3}{2} and we have here two out of spin doublets with isospin \\frac{1}{2}.\n\n\n1.5 Experimental Significance and Historical Context\nWhat is this good for in isospin? You will later also see in the exercises that we can actually use this quantum number to see why certain cross sections that were measured are of different sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Diagram showing the cross section on the y-axis and the mass on the x-axis, with two curves representing pπ⁺ and pπ⁻ interactions. A clear resonance peak appears at the Δ mass, indicating the formation of the Δ resonance during scattering.\n\n\n\nIf we take for example the cross section for \\pi^+ p and for \\pi^- p, if you look here in the delta mass region, you see that there is a factor of three difference: \\frac{\\sigma_{\\pi^+p}}{\\sigma_{\\pi^-p}} \\approx 3:1. You can figure out in the exercises and classwork why there are differences in the cross sections between the different reactions.\nI introduced this isospin concept for protons and neutrons. How was that in experiment? They also write like up and down quarks—that wasn’t there. This concept in the 1950s: how should you imagine this? They saw like, oh, well, you produce pions and rho—was it also there? Yes, they also found rho later on. They introduced this concept to find symmetries or something. They were first just looking for patterns that they could find between different particles. This was like purely mathematical looking: just how can we group these together?\nIf you take the isospin, then we can already group some of these particles together. Like I said, we can group the pions or the rhos into triplets. We can have the delta in an isospin quadruplet and things like this. Then later bigger patterns were also seen. That’s where this lecture is headed towards: we will look later next into the strangeness and then hypercharge and so on.\nThe reason why I’m asking is because if you look just at protons and neutrons, you might initially think, oh, you have spin and charge and that’s all they do. Why would you introduce isospin? But it’s only when you do these kinds of reactions: proton-proton, proton-neutron, and neutron-neutron, and if you see that the reaction rates are pretty much the same, then you can come to the conclusion: okay, maybe the strong interaction doesn’t care about whether it’s a proton or a neutron. That’s where the isospin idea came from.\nIt comes down to once you start to look at cross sections, you start to see that certain reactions are stronger and you need to introduce new concepts in the theory. Here it was actually that they are pretty much similar. If you look at these different experiments and you see that the strong interaction does not seem to care about whether it’s a proton or a neutron, on quark level it means then it doesn’t care about up or down quark. That’s why we also placed not just the proton and neutron into an isospin doublet, but also the up and down quarks."

    "text": "2 The Eightfold Way and Quark Model\nSo first, physicists had this kind of an isospin doublet. They found all these other particles like the pions and kaons and grouped them together, then looked for bigger patterns with also the strangeness included as the next quantum number.\nAround the 1960s, with the Bevatron experiment and large accelerators accessible, they found over 100 particles and didn’t know what to do with them. They later found out we can actually decompose them into smaller particles to understand how, and we are still trying to understand.\nSome particles detected behaved in a strange manner. For example, in cosmic rays with pions going to a carbon target, they could see in a cloud chamber four tracks which look like a V: \\pi^+, \\pi^-, proton, and \\pi^-.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A π⁻ from cosmic rays collides with a proton, initiating decay chains involving several intermediate particles. The π⁻ decays into a K⁰ and a Λ⁰, which subsequently decay into π⁻π⁺ and pπ⁻ respectively, illustrating hadronic decay processes.\n\n\n\nThese particles always appeared in pairs and had a fairly long lifetime.\nThey concluded by introducing a new quantum number strangeness and said that it needs to be conserved. Isospin is also a quantum number conserved in strong interactions.\nHow do we assign this quantum number? Particles consisting of up and down quarks have strangeness S = 0, for example pion, neutron, proton. Particles with strangeness S = +1 include lambda, and in general these are called hyperons. There are different types of hyperons like lambda, sigmas, cascades, and kaons.\nWith this we can form two isospin doublets with K^+ and K^0, and similarly K^- and \\bar{K^0} in an isospin doublet with strangeness S = -1. They figured since these two come always in pairs that this quantum number needs to be conserved in strong interaction, but it is not conserved in weak interaction.\nLooking at the lambda decay \\Lambda \\to p + \\pi^-, both products don’t have strangeness but this decay can happen. From the long lifetime this means weak decay. They are produced in strong interaction because we have \\pi + p \\to p + K^+ and n \\to hypercharge.\nHypercharge Y is given by baryon number B and strangeness number S: Y = B + S. For baryon number, if it’s a baryon then it gets B = +1, if it’s an antibaryon then B = -1, and if it’s a meson then B = 0.\nWe can’t have certain reactions. For example, if here we didn’t have a lambda but a proton, then this would not happen. Same way here, if you have lambda then we can’t have a \\pi in here. This always comes in pairs, so the strangeness number is conserved.\nAlso if you have \\pi^- in a proton beam, then you can’t have suddenly in the end two mesons only. There needs to be a baryon as well, so the baryon number is conserved.\nFrom isospin, we had the isospin triplet with projections +1, 0, and -1 correlating to charge: -1 for \\pi^-, 0 for \\pi^0, and +1 for \\pi^+. There seems to be a relationship between isospin and charge.\nThis is what Gell-Mann and Nishijima calculation tells us: the charge can be expressed as the third component of the isospin plus the hypercharge divided by two: Q = I_3 + \\frac{Y}{2}.\nLet’s check this formula:\n\nFor proton, I = \\frac{1}{2} and I_3 = +\\frac{1}{2}. Hypercharge: strangeness S = 0 for proton, but it’s a baryon so B = 1, giving Y = 1. Using the relation, charge Q = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = +1, as expected.\nFor neutron, I_3 = -\\frac{1}{2}, Y = 1, giving Q = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Formulas:\n\nGell-Mann–Nishijima Formula: Q = I_3 + \\frac{Y}{2} relates electric charge to isospin and hypercharge\nHypercharge Definition: Y = B + S combines baryon number and strangeness\nConservation Laws: \\sum B_{\\text{initial}} = \\sum B_{\\text{final}} and \\sum S_{\\text{initial}} = \\sum S_{\\text{final}} (strong interactions only)\n\n\n\n\nUsing strangeness and/or hypercharge in combination with isospin, Gell-Mann and Ne’eman found a much larger pattern for these particles. They can be arranged in bigger multiplets, called the eightfold way.\nFor these larger patterns they looked not just at the up and down quark, but also included the strange quark. Now we are in the SU(3) flavor symmetry. At the time they didn’t know these different quarks existed, but we are just going to look at it in this way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Diagram plotting the z-component of isospin on the x-axis and strangeness (S) on the y-axis. An inverted triangle connects the up, down, and strange quarks, with each vertex labeled by its corresponding quantum numbers, visualizing the quark model’s flavor structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Diagram with strangeness on the y-axis and the third component of isospin on the x-axis, showing the baryon octet. Each vertex of the hexagonal arrangement represents a baryon with its quark composition, demonstrating SU(3) flavor symmetry.\n\n\n\nPlotting the third component of isospin against strangeness for the up, down, and strange quarks, let’s write down the quantum numbers:\n\nFor baryon number each gets \\frac{1}{3} because up, up, down gives total 1\nCharge for up is +\\frac{2}{3}, for down is -\\frac{1}{3}\nThey’re all fermions with spin \\frac{1}{2}\nStrangeness for strange quark is -1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Depiction of a baryon decuplet multiplet including Ω⁻, Ξ⁻, Ξ⁰, Σ⁻, Σ⁰, Σ*⁺, and the four Δ states (Δ⁻, Δ⁰, Δ⁺, Δ⁺⁺). Diagonals denote electric charge (Q) and horizontal lines indicate strangeness, with mass differences of roughly 150 MeV between each level.\n\n\n\nNow looking at bigger patterns for baryons. Baryons are composed of three quarks from up, down, or strange: \\mathbf{3} \\otimes \\mathbf{3} \\otimes \\mathbf{3} = \\mathbf{10} \\oplus \\mathbf{8} \\oplus \\mathbf{8} \\oplus \\mathbf{1}. This gives a decuplet and octets. We look at ground state variants arranged into an octet and decuplet.\nPlotting third component of isospin against strangeness (or hypercharge), we have S = 0, -1, -2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Meson octet diagram showing K⁰, K⁺, π⁻, η, π⁰, π⁺, K⁻, and K̄⁰. The y-axis represents strangeness, the x-axis represents the third component of isospin, and diagonal lines indicate electric charge (Q), highlighting SU(3) meson symmetry.\n\n\n\nOn the horizontal axis are isospin multiplets: isospin doublet for neutron and proton, triplet for sigmas, doublet for cascades.\nPointing out positions: here is I_3 = +\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}, here I_3 = 0, here S = -1. You can see quark content: here all with one strange quark, here with two strange quarks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Table listing the u, d, and s quarks along with their fundamental quantum numbers. Entries include baryon number (B), electric charge (Q), spin, strangeness (S), isospin (I), z-component of isospin (I₃), and hypercharge (Y).\n\n\n\nLooking at masses:\n\nProton and neutron masses are almost the same, difference about 1 MeV\nSimilar for isospin partners\nBut in vertical direction, mass difference is much larger: sigma mass difference about 250 MeV, here to here about 130 MeV\n\nThis tells us that isospin symmetry in SU(2) is a good symmetry, but including strange quark it’s pretty much broken. It’s only an approximate symmetry because otherwise we would have same masses for all.\nWorking out the pattern: upper row has data, down here only minus. On this axis highest third component, along this axis strangeness 0, -1, -2.\nAll these particles have spin in common. Baryons in octet have spin \\frac{1}{2} and parity +. For decuplet, spin \\frac{3}{2} and parity +. Here spins can be aligned or permutations giving \\frac{1}{2}, here all aligned.\nWhen this pattern was found, the \\Omega^- was not yet discovered. This was a big success to predict its existence, found two years later in bubble chamber experiments with K^- + p \\to \\Omega^- + K^+ + K^0. For strangeness conservation, we need two more kaons.\n\\Omega^- decays into cascade \\Xi^-, then further to \\Lambda^0 + \\pi^0, \\pi^0 \\to 2\\gamma, and \\Lambda \\to p + \\pi^-. Not only predicted existence but roughly predicted mass: looking at masses between horizontal lines, \\Delta mass 1232 MeV, sigmas, then \\Omega^- mass around 1680 MeV, with mass spacing roughly 150 MeV.\nAll these considerations come from group theory, mathematical descriptions of particles with symmetry considerations. Difference between masses in octet and decuplet is that spin is different, so mass difference accounted to spin-spin or spin-orbit interactions from dynamics. For mesons, with up, down, strange quarks, \\mathbf{3} \\otimes \\bar{\\mathbf{3}} = \\mathbf{8} \\oplus \\mathbf{1}. On diagonal you have charge: here all charge -1, middle charge 0, +1, +2. This octet or nonet including \\eta' has quantum numbers 0^-+.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Vector meson octet including ρ⁻, ω, ρ⁰, ρ⁺, and the K* mesons with charges 0, +, −, and anti-0. The diagram mirrors the pseudoscalar meson octet structure, illustrating similar flavor symmetry among vector mesons.\n\n\n\nThis means quark-antiquark pair have anti-parallel spins, parity -. For spins aligned parallel, spin 1, parity -1, charge conjugation C. Parity inverts spatial coordinates, charge conjugation converts particle to antiparticle.\nFor baryons, if you know orbital angular momentum L, parity P = (-1)^L. For octet ground states L = 0, parity + for \\frac{1}{2}^+ and \\frac{3}{2}^+. For mesons, P = (-1)^{L+1}, giving - for both. Charge conjugation well-defined for neutral mesons, e.g., \\pi^0 has C = +1.\nFor decays, parity and C parity are multiplicative. Combining spins of different particles to get total spin. Example: can \\omega meson decay into two pions? For \\pi^0, C = +1, multiplied gives +1, but for \\omega, C = -1, so cannot happen.\nLastly, consider quark content for \\Omega^- or \\Delta^{++}. All spins aligned, flavor content same. With Pauli exclusion principle for fermions, they should be distinguishable by one quantum number. Looking at total wave function: spatial, spin, and flavor.\nFor L = 0, spatial wave function symmetric. Spins all aligned up, symmetric. Flavor all same, symmetric. Physicists introduced new quantum number: color charge. This part of wave function must be antisymmetric to get total antisymmetric wave function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: A step-like diagram with energy ω (in GeV) on the x-axis, showing three discrete levels corresponding to accessible quark flavors. The steps mark quark sets (u,d,s), (u,d,s,c), and (u,d,s,c,b,t), each annotated with example hadrons, providing evidence for the existence of color charge.\n\n\n\nAssign each quark different color: red, green, blue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParity Formulas:\n\nBaryons: P = (-1)^L (ground states have L = 0, P = +)\nMesons: P = (-1)^{L+1} (ground states have L = 0, P = -)\nMultiplet Decompositions:\n\nBaryons: \\mathbf{3} \\otimes \\mathbf{3} \\otimes \\mathbf{3} = \\mathbf{10} \\oplus \\mathbf{8} \\oplus \\mathbf{8} \\oplus \\mathbf{1}\nMesons: \\mathbf{3} \\otimes \\bar{\\mathbf{3}} = \\mathbf{8} \\oplus \\mathbf{1}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Feynman diagram illustrating electron–positron annihilation producing a virtual photon. The photon subsequently decays into either a quark–antiquark pair or a lepton pair, with an example of a μ⁺μ⁻ final state shown.\n\n\n\nBriefly discuss experiment showing three colors. Looked into e^+ e^- annihilation with virtual photon exchanged, producing different particles: quark-antiquark pairs or leptons like \\mu^+ \\mu^-.\nMeasured ratio R = \\frac{\\sigma(e^+ e^- \\to \\text{hadrons})}{\\sigma(e^+ e^- \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-)}. For leptons no color, so dividing gives proportionality to number of colors. Photon vertex proportional to charge squared, different quark types.\nInitially up, down, strange quarks measured as peaks in spectrum (rho, omega, pi mesons). When energy high enough, produce charm-anticharm bound states (J/ψ), then B bar states. Calculated steps show number of colors should be three.\nThis was historical background on how from detected particles, patterns were seen using eightfold way strangeness, later forming quark model where particles consist of smaller quarks with six flavors and three colors."

    "text": "3 Unraveling Strange Particles and Quantum Numbers\nGenerally, what I always find difficult with histories like what is known versus what’s not known relates back to my previous question about particle identification methods.\nI should have perhaps asked this earlier when you introduced strangeness in the context of cosmic rays.\n\n3.1 Particle Identification Through Invariant Mass\nThe fundamental practical question is: how do you distinguish kaons from other particles using just invariant masses? (see Figure 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvariant Mass Formula: M^2 = \\left(\\sum E_i\\right)^2 - \\left(\\sum \\vec{p}_i\\right)^2 This relativistic invariant allows identification of particle resonances from decay products. When analyzing cosmic ray events with protons and pions, peaks in the invariant mass spectrum reveal new particles like kaons.\n\n\n\nYou can only look at the invariant mass in these cases. You detect the proton and the pions, then examine the spectra to identify what’s known versus unknown.\n\n\n3.2 Historical Discovery Timeline and Strange Particles\nThese particles were called “strange” because researchers were confused about why they only appeared in pairs and had longer lifetimes than other particles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrangeness Conservation: \\Delta S = 0 This quantum number explains why strange particles (like kaons) are always produced in pairs and have unexpectedly long lifetimes. Violation occurs only through weak interactions.\n\n\n\nThe pions were discovered relatively quickly after fundamental particles:\n\nProtons were known early\nNeutrons discovered in 1932\nLater in the 1950s: antiprotons and many other particles emerged\n\nSince many are charged, you can measure them directly.\n\n\n3.3 Conservation Laws and Quantum Numbers\nYou mentioned C-parity - how was that introduced? Was it used to say certain decays aren’t allowed? (see Figure 11)\nActually, I think it worked the other way around: researchers observed that certain decays weren’t measured, suggesting some quantum number must be violated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharge Conjugation (C-parity): C|\\psi\\rangle = \\eta_C|\\psi\\rangle C-parity describes how particles transform into their antiparticles under charge conjugation, providing selection rules for decays.\n\n\n\nI don’t know exactly when charge conjugation was introduced, but it emerged when people started thinking systematically about particles and antiparticles - directly with the positron in the 1930s, before the antiproton discovery.\nThis highlights the difficulty: sometimes concepts come from theory, sometimes from experiments. It’s interesting how the omega baryon was predicted, but also how quantum numbers were introduced based on cross-section measurements.\n\n\n3.4 Quark Model Development and Mass Patterns\nHistorically, the multiplets were mostly correct - I only added the quark content for clarity. When multiplets were assembled, researchers postulated there might be smaller substructure, initially called “partons” before becoming “quarks.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuark Model Mass Relations: M(\\Omega^-) - M(\\Xi^*) \\approx M(\\Xi^*) - M(\\Sigma^*) \\approx M(\\Sigma^*) - M(\\Delta) \\approx 150\\text{ MeV} The regular mass spacing in baryon multiplets provided crucial evidence for the quark model, suggesting these particles differ by replacing one quark with a heavier strange quark.\n\n\n\nThe mass differences already indicated there should be different quark content in these particles - for the deltas, sigmas, cascades, and so on. Researchers observed these mass differences and reasoned that the last undetected particle would also have approximately 150 MeV more mass than the others, which turned out to be correct.\nThe original quark paper is remarkably brief - just two pages - so you can easily look up how they introduced the concept.\nIt was an exciting time: they predicted the omega-minus in the quark model, and it was experimentally detected and discovered in 1964.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOmega-Minus Discovery: K^- + p \\to \\Omega^- + K^+ + K^0 This was the experimental reaction that discovered the \\Omega^- particle, confirming quark model predictions."
