Essentially, I like thinking of the evolution of the universe on a timescale. Here is the origin of the universe where everything started. There was a Big Bang first, and then several epochs followed. It started with the Planck epoch, then there was the electroweak epoch, quarks, and others. What has been happening during this is part of the physics that we also go through in the courses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHiggs Mechanism and Symmetry Breaking\nThe Higgs potential—the field giving mass to particles and ensuring protons don’t decay so life can exist—obtains a condensate during the electroweak epoch. The potential is given by:\n  \nV(\\phi) = \\mu^2 |\\phi|^2 + \\lambda |\\phi|^4  \n\nwhere \\phi is the Higgs field, \\mu^2 &lt; 0 triggers symmetry breaking, and \\lambda is the self-coupling constant.\n\n\n\nEssentially, let me start with the electroweak epoch, where the Higgs potential forms a condensate. The field that drives electroweak physics fills the entire space, creating a condensate of the Higgs field. Through this condensate, particles are slowed down, gain inertia, and obtain mass—this is the Higgs mechanism. The process of the potential evolving is called spontaneous symmetry breaking, where one of the minima is peaked. That’s how I like thinking about the electroweak stage.\n\nThen, particles have masses, the universe starts evolving, and at some point, we arrive at the quark epoch, where the universe is filled with a quark-gluon plasma. Essentially, quarks and gluons make an unstructured soup of objects—quarks, gluons, and more. There is nothing about structure formation yet; it’s just quarks disturbing. There is no scale to discuss yet. Quarks and gluons are together, and the universe is extremely hot. From that moment, it starts cooling down. At some point, the temperature is low enough that this medium starts separating, and we arrive at the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) epoch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNuclear Size Scaling\nThe radius R of a nucleus scales with the number of nucleons A as:\n  \nR \\approx r_0 A^{1/3}  \n\nwhere r_0 \\approx 1.2 \\, \\text{fm} (Fermi).\n\n\n\nThis medium starts forming small volumes where quark and gluon interactions bind to a scalable level. If you think of this, you’d need two years to learn it in detail. This comes in particle physics, introductory nuclear physics, and specialized courses on QCD or statistical mechanics. You could have a special course on QCD at finite temperature, since it’s a heated medium with different laws applied to what we’ll discuss for strong interactions.\n\nHydrogen is what we’ll focus on now. But if you think of how quickly this happened, you’ll be slightly surprised. Essentially, this is… do you have a guess? 10^{-36} seconds (Planck), 10^{-12} (electroweak), 10^{-6}, then 10^{-3}, and finally 1 second. Imagine there was nothing, and then the time it takes for sound to reach you when I clap—about 10 milliseconds—by that time, we’d already passed through all these stages and everything had formed. That’s how quickly the universe evolved.\n\nThe rest of the timeline to the present 13.8 billion years has other interesting physics, but not as intense from the perspective of hadron physics. Hadrons are objects where strong interactions are confined to a scale of a few femtometers (10^{-15} \\, \\text{m}). There’s essentially nothing around—just small chunks of volume where quarks and gluons interact. By colliding hadrons, we study their internal structure, but there’s no natural scale smaller than this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProton Mass Decomposition\nThe proton mass m_p is dominated by QCD energy (gluon condensate):\n  \nm_p \\approx 938 \\, \\text{MeV}, \\quad \\text{with} \\quad m_{\\text{quarks}} \\sim 9 \\, \\text{MeV} \\quad (\\text{only} \\sim 1\\%)  \n\nThe remainder arises from strong interaction energy.\n\n\n\nConcerning empty space, let’s sketch one of the most common elements on Earth. From the periodic table, what is it? Oxygen. Oxygen-16 (or 18) has 8 protons and 8 (or 10) neutrons. The geometry of this atom is a core of protons and neutrons, with electrons compensating the charge. The nucleus scales as the number of nucleons to the power of 1/3 (volume scaling). Packing 16 nucleons gives a radius of about 3 fm. Electrons, however, have wave functions 3 orders of magnitude larger (~50 picometers). This shows how empty space is—a tiny core surrounded by vast electron space with no strong interactions.\n\nNow, the fundamental hardware: the Standard Model describes most known interactions (excluding neutrinos’ open questions). The part responsible for strong interactions is quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The participants are quarks and gluons, the only particles carrying color charge—similar to electric charge but distinct. Color charge is a quantum number; we describe it via color wave functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQCD and QED Lagrangians\nThe Lagrangian density for QCD is:\n  \n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{QCD}} = \\bar{\\psi}_i (i \\gamma^\\mu D_\\mu - m) \\psi_i - \\frac{1}{4} G^a_{\\mu\\nu} G_a^{\\mu\\nu}  \n\nwhere D_\\mu = \\partial_\\mu - i g_s A_\\mu^a T^a and G^a_{\\mu\\nu} is the gluon field strength.\nFor QED:\n  \n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{QED}} = \\bar{\\psi} (i \\gamma^\\mu D_\\mu - m) \\psi - \\frac{1}{4} F_{\\mu\\nu} F^{\\mu\\nu}  \n\nwhere D_\\mu = \\partial_\\mu - i e A_\\mu.\n\n\n\nOther Standard Model particles (electrons, muons, taus, photons, neutrinos) don’t carry color charge and don’t interact strongly. Quarks come in six types: up (charge +2/3), down (-1/3), charm, strange, top, bottom. They’re grouped by generation (light: u/d; heavier: s/c; heaviest: t/b). Most matter is made of first-generation quarks. Strange quarks may affect neutron star equations of state. Charm and bottom are studied in high-energy collisions; the top quark’s lifetime is too short for hadronization.\n\nHadrons are classified as mesons (quark-antiquark) or baryons (three quarks). At the chiral symmetry breaking scale, gluons condense, dressing quarks and giving them effective mass. The proton’s mass is ~1 GeV, but the Higgs contributes only ~1% (3 MeV per quark); 99% comes from QCD energy (gluon condensate).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatural Units Conversion\nIn natural units (\\hbar = c = 1):\n  \n1 \\, \\text{GeV}^{-1} \\approx 0.197 \\, \\text{fm}, \\quad 1 \\, \\text{GeV} \\approx 1.783 \\times 10^{-27} \\, \\text{kg}  \n\nRelating energy, mass, and length scales.\n\n\n\nNow, quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and quantum electrodynamics (QED) share a Lagrangian framework. QED’s Lagrangian is:\n  \n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{QED}} = \\bar{\\psi} (i \\gamma^\\mu D_\\mu - m) \\psi - \\frac{1}{4} F_{\\mu\\nu} F^{\\mu\\nu},  \n\nwhere D_\\mu = \\partial_\\mu - i e A_\\mu. Maxwell’s equations in covariant form are \\partial_\\mu F^{\\mu\\nu} = j^\\nu. QCD’s Lagrangian adds color charge:\n  \n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{QCD}} = \\bar{\\psi}_i (i \\gamma^\\mu D_\\mu - m) \\psi_i - \\frac{1}{4} G^a_{\\mu\\nu} G_a^{\\mu\\nu},  \n\nwith D_\\mu = \\partial_\\mu - i g_s A_\\mu^a T^a and G^a_{\\mu\\nu} as the gluon field strength.\nNatural units (\\hbar = c = 1) simplify conversions: 1 \\, \\text{GeV}^{-1} \\approx 0.197 \\, \\text{fm}; 1 \\, \\text{GeV} \\approx 1.78 \\times 10^{-27} \\, \\text{kg}.\n\n\n0.3 Einstein Notation, Gauge Invariance, and Fermion Interactions in Field Theory\nAnother thing to note is that here I am explicitly using Einstein notation and summing over repeated indices.\n\n\\mu here, \\mu there—they are repeated.\n\nThis means that if I were precise, I should have written here a sum from \\mu=1 to 4 over all components.\n\nThe \\nu is a repeated index again, so we sum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummation Example: For F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}, expanding the sum yields 4 \\times 4 = 16 terms (4 components per index). If multiplied by another term with 4 components, the total becomes 16 \\times 4 = 64 terms.\n\n\n\n\nThe equation of motion for this Lagrangian is obtained using the Euler-Lagrange equation.\n\nYou might remember this from classical mechanics where we had dots, and the first term was the time derivative, the second was the derivative of the field.\n\nEssentially, we treat the Lagrangian as a function of the field derivatives and the fields themselves as independent objects.\n\nFirst, we differentiate with respect to the derivatives, and then with respect to the fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Insight: In classical mechanics, these would be the momentum terms, but here they are field variables. The index \\mu is summed over—a simple summation.\n\n\n\nThe derivative is with respect to A_\\rho (another index convention). If I take this Lagrangian, where everything is defined, and use the Euler-Lagrange equation, I get the equation of motion describing how the field propagates through space. We know this gives Maxwell’s equations.\n\nNow let me introduce the second part. This was the gauge field. Let me label it 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nThis is a less intuitive concept that you might not have seen before, but we will need it.\n\nThere are degrees of freedom that are not fixed for photons in the electromagnetic field, and there is an arbitrary gauge choice we can make.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGauge Transformation:\n  \nA_\\mu \\rightarrow A'_\\mu = A_\\mu - \\partial_\\mu \\chi  \n\nwhere \\chi is an arbitrary scalar field. Under this, F_{\\mu\\nu} remains invariant: F'_{\\mu\\nu} = F_{\\mu\\nu}.\n\n\n\nThis is a symmetry of the Lagrangian—the gauge symmetry. If you derive Maxwell’s equations from the Lagrangian, you’ll get them up to a gauge term. By fixing the gauge, you recover the standard Maxwell equations.\n\nNow we introduce fermion fields.\n\nIn electrodynamics, our leptons are described by the Dirac field \\psi, a four-component spinor (not a four-vector).\n\nThe Lagrangian is a scalar quantity—no free indices—and is constructed from objects of different dimensionality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpinor Properties:\n\n\\psi describes spin-1/2 particles with four components (particle + antiparticle).\n\nThe adjoint spinor is \\bar{\\psi} = \\psi^\\dagger \\gamma^0.\n\nThe Dirac Lagrangian:\n  \n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Dirac}} = \\bar{\\psi} (i \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m) \\psi  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe equation of motion is the Dirac equation: (i\\not{\\partial} - m)\\psi = 0 (using Feynman slash notation).\n\nTo introduce interactions, we use gauge invariance.\n\nFor fermions, gauge invariance means changing the phase of \\psi locally at every space-time point.\n\nThe tricky part is that \\partial_\\mu \\psi introduces extra terms under a space-dependent phase transformation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovariant Derivative Fix:\nReplace \\partial_\\mu with D_\\mu = \\partial_\\mu + ieA_\\mu. Under simultaneous transformations of \\psi and A_\\mu, the Lagrangian remains invariant.\n\n\n\nThis is the essence of QED: interactions arise from requiring invariance under local phase transformations.\n\nThe same principle applies to other gauge theories (e.g., SU(2) for electroweak, SU(3) for QCD).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Difference in QCD:\n\nGluons self-interact due to non-Abelian structure (terms like f^{abc} in G^a_{\\mu\\nu}).\n\nCoupling runs with energy: asymptotic freedom (weak at high energy) vs. confinement (strong at low energy).\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, in perturbation theory, we compute scattering amplitudes using Feynman diagrams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross-Section and Decay Width:\n\nCross-section:\n  \n\\sigma = \\frac{1}{2E_A 2E_B |v_A - v_B|} \\int |\\mathcal{M}|^2 \\, d\\Pi_{\\text{phase space}}  \n\nDecay width:\n  \n\\Gamma = \\frac{1}{2m} \\int |\\mathcal{M}|^2 \\, d\\Pi_{\\text{phase space}}  \n\n\n\n\n\nThese connect field theory to measurable quantities in experiments.\n\n\n0.4 Course Logistics, Exam Details, and Summer School Opportunities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture & Exercise Schedule\nIt’s really nice to have a watch today.

    "text": "6 Applications and Homework\nWe will continue discussing angular distributions after the Dalitz plot. The homework exercise on Dalitz plots connects directly to hadron spectroscopy, which is the focus of upcoming lectures.\nKey realization: For any N-body process, once you specify the kinematic variables, you can completely reconstruct the “rigid body” configuration of all momentum vectors in the center-of-mass frame.\nThe recursive phase space formula demonstrates that the Jacobian for transformation to Mandelstam variables is constant, making these variables ideal for studying interaction dynamics through Dalitz plot analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A sketch illustrating the recursive relation when computing the phase-space expression. This is not a dynamic assumption but a mathematical trick that rewrites the full three-body phase-space through lower-dimensional phase-space elements and the two-body phase-space, for which the expression is simple.\n\n\n\n\n6.1 Decoding the Λc Dalitz Plot\nYou can see the example of the triple decay that I have here of the \\Lambda_c baryon going to the proton, kaon, and pion: \\Lambda_c^+ \\to p + K^- + \\pi^+\nWe measure \\Lambda_c produced in proton-proton collisions or any other collisions. In experiments, they observe \\Lambda_c abundantly. This is one of the particles that lives long enough and is produced copiously.\nParticles with charm ground states are produced abundantly and live sufficiently long to fly from the primary vertex. That’s why we have a good sample and a good understanding of their decay kinematics—not only kinematics, but dynamics as well. (see Figure~6)\nIn this decay, there is a charm quark in the initial state and no charm quark in the final state, indicating that this occurs via weak interaction. The charm quark disappears between initial and final states: the charm quark decays, transitioning into a strange quark that ends up in the kaon. This c \\to s transition happens within one generation and is not suppressed—it is an allowed process.\nThis decay is considered a golden channel for detection because:\n\nThe final state contains three charged particles—there are no neutrals.\nThe proton is charged, travels well, and is stable.\nThe kaon and pion are stable in our accelerator experiments.\n\nThese particles fly from the decay without distraction, and we see their tracks clearly through all detectors. They point away from the primary interaction vertex.\nThere is roughly a 1 cm shift between the primary vertex and the secondary vertex in \\Lambda_c decays. This displacement occurs due to the boost and the fact that \\Lambda_c lives longer in the laboratory frame than in its rest frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decay length in the laboratory frame is given by: L = \\beta\\gamma c\\tau At the LHC, \\Lambda_c is produced with energies of a few hundred GeV, making this decay particularly clean and well-suited for study.\n\n\n\nWe have studied this decay extensively. Here is the result of an analysis that resembles experimental data. If I showed you actual experimental data, you wouldn’t distinguish it from this plot—the statistics are so high that the distribution appears very smooth.\n\nOn the x-axis: invariant mass of the proton and kaon, m_{12}^2\nOn the y-axis: invariant mass of the kaon and pion, m_{23}^2\n\nAll allowed kinematic values for the decay are shown in color. (see Figure~6) The white area corresponds to kinematics where no physical configuration exists—energy and momentum cannot be conserved there.\nIf you select a point inside the colored region, you can compute angles between particles and reproduce the configuration with a 3D-printed rigid body. But if you choose a point in the white region, you quickly find that energy conservation cannot be satisfied.\nThe range of possible values for the invariant masses is limited, and this surface is called the Dalitz plot. The kinematic boundaries are defined by:\nm_{12}^2 + m_{23}^2 + m_{13}^2 = m_{\\Lambda_c}^2 + m_p^2 + m_K^2 + m_{\\pi}^2\nDifferent colors in the plot indicate different probabilities for the decay to occur at that kinematic point. (see Figure~6) The differential decay rate in the Dalitz plot is:\n\\frac{d^2\\Gamma}{dm_{12}^2  dm_{23}^2} \\propto |\\mathcal{M}|^2\nWe measure the decay by reconstructing particle tracks and identifying from which kinematic point the decay originated. There is an unambiguous relation between four-vectors and kinematic points. (see Figure~3)\nIt turns out that certain kinematics are more probable than others—particles prefer specific directions. For example, one configuration may be more common, while another is rare. On the border of the Dalitz plot, particles are aligned in one line, whereas inside the surface they always have an angle between them.\nThink about how to maximize the invariant mass and where on the border such a point lies.\n\n\n6.2 Dalitz Plot Kinematics in Three-Body Decay\nLet’s consider the three-body decay \\Lambda_c^+ \\to pK^-\\pi^+ and its kinematics. (see Figure~1) We want to maximize the invariant mass of the proton–Kaon system. (see Figure~6)\nThere are three outgoing momenta. The idea is that if the three momenta are arranged in opposite directions, the total three-momentum sum should be as small as possible. (see Figure~6)\nIf we add both momentum vectors, the forward momentum—or more precisely, the magnitude of the sum of the momentum vectors—should be as large as possible. Therefore, we should be on the right side of the Dalitz plot diagram.\nNow, consider the mass on the y-axis: should it be as large or as small as possible? (see Figure~3) It should be as small as possible.\nWhy? Because when the three momenta are collinear and we subtract them appropriately, the invariant mass is minimized.\nOne way to think about this is to go to the rest frame of the Kaon and pion. If they are flying nearly together, their relative momentum is small. In their mutual rest frame, they could both be at rest, so their invariant mass would simply be the sum of their rest masses—this is the minimum possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe minimum invariant mass for any two-particle system is given by M_{ij}^{\\text{min}} = m_i + m_j This occurs when the two particles are at rest relative to each other.\n\n\n\nYou are correct: we are looking for the minimal invariant mass of the proton–Kaon system.\nLet’s identify what this point corresponds to kinematically. In certain configurations, two particles can be nearly at rest while the third carries away the momentum. (see Figure~6) That corresponds to the minimal invariant mass case.\nThis plot is likely from experimental data. How would we reconstruct such an event experimentally if we don’t detect the proton directly? Even though measurements occur in the lab frame (which is boosted), the analysis is often performed in the center-of-mass frame.\nThe point of maximum invariant mass occurs when the two particles move back-to-back with maximum momentum. The point we are discussing minimizes the invariant mass.\nFor three-body decays, there is a similar way to define angular variables. (see Figure~1) Let me briefly mention this.\nI will boost into the rest frame for each kinematic setup. To clarify, I am referring to the proton, Kaon, and pion. Suppose I fix the invariant mass of the proton–Kaon system.\nThe approach is to work in the center-of-momentum frame of the \\Lambda_c, where the three final-state particles have momenta summing to zero. Then, I boost to the rest frame of the Kaon and pion. (see Figure~6) In that frame, the Kaon and pion have equal and opposite momenta. (see Figure~7)\nIf I fix the invariant mass of the proton–Kaon system and explore phase space along a line where that mass is fixed, the magnitudes of the momenta are fixed—only the angle \\theta changes.\nAs \\theta varies from 0 to \\pi, one extreme (\\theta = 0) corresponds to the proton and Kaon moving in the same direction, yielding a small invariant mass. The other extreme (\\theta = \\pi) corresponds to them moving oppositely, giving the maximum invariant mass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe invariant mass squared for two particles is M_{ij}^2 = (p_i + p_j)^2 = (E_i + E_j)^2 - (\\vec{p}_i + \\vec{p}_j)^2 This quantity is Lorentz invariant and is used to define Dalitz plot axes.\n\n\n\nFor angle \\theta = 0, the invariant mass is small. As the angle increases, the invariant mass grows. The same logic applies to the other pairings.\nA straightforward analysis method is to go to the rest frame of the proton–Kaon system, where all quantities are fixed, and scan by changing the angle between the proton and Kaon relative to the pion direction. (see Figure~6)\nThus, lines in the Dalitz plot represent configurations where the angle is varied in some rest frame.\nAnother variable in 2 \\to 2 scattering kinematics is the U variable, which offers a more symmetric treatment. For three-body decays, we also have the invariant mass of the pion–proton system.\nIf I fix the invariant mass of the proton–Kaon system and scan the angle, which line do I move along? This follows from the relation that the U variable is a linear combination of the invariant masses.\nIn fact, the coefficients are such that the motion corresponds to a diagonal in the Dalitz plot. This line represents a fixed pion–proton invariant mass, moving from one kinematic endpoint to the other.\nThe standard representation in experimental analyses uses Dalitz plots with the x-axis as the invariant mass squared of one pair and the y-axis as the invariant mass squared of another pair—exactly what is shown here.\nIn homework, you may encounter a more symmetric Dalitz plot where all variables enter symmetrically. This uses the geometry of an equilateral triangle, where every point inside satisfies a conservation relation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the symmetric representation, the coordinates are x = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(M_{12}^2 - M_{23}^2), \\quad y = M_{13}^2 - \\frac{1}{2}(M_{12}^2 + M_{23}^2) The factor \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} arises from the 60° angles in an equilateral triangle.\n\n\n\nIf you sum the perpendicular distances from any interior point to the three sides of an equilateral triangle, the total is constant. This allows us to define symmetric variables representing the sum of the invariant masses.\nThe variables are interpreted as distances to the sides. This gives a very symmetric and elegant representation.\nEssentially, this is equivalent to the standard plot—they are related by a linear transformation, not just a rotation but also a skew. To plot experimental data in this form, one must apply the correct coordinate transformation.\nYesterday, I worked through the algebra relating Cartesian coordinates to the heights in the triangle—it’s straightforward but interesting.\nThis symmetric representation is nice, while the standard one is more common and easier to plot directly. Both capture the same kinematics.\nIn the Dalitz plot, regions with higher event density indicate kinematic enhancements. The purpose of this kinematic representation is to identify the dynamics and underlying processes governing the decay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A kinematic representation of the transition from the initial state to the final state in the process where particle 0 decays into particle x and particle 3. The arrows indicate the three-momenta of particles 3 and x, and the fat dot marks particle 0, which is at rest in this frame.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, we will see that \\Lambda_c decay to three particles often proceeds via intermediate resonances. Temporarily, two particles form a resonant state that then decays, increasing the decay rate in certain invariant mass regions.\nWhen the energy of two particles matches a resonance, their interaction is stronger, making the decay more probable. This is why we observe enhanced densities along certain bands in the Dalitz plot.\n\n\n6.3 Resonance Structures and Angular Distributions in Three-Body Decays\nYou might have seen cross sections for two-particle resonances. These exhibit a characteristic bump known as a hadronic resonance. The underlying physics is that when you have a system of two particles, and the quantum numbers of that system match those of an intermediate resonance, the interaction probability increases dramatically at specific energies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Breit-Wigner resonance cross section describes this enhancement: \n\\sigma(E) \\propto \\frac{\\Gamma^2/4}{(E - E_R)^2 + \\Gamma^2/4}\n where E_R is the resonance energy and \\Gamma is the resonance width.\n\n\n\nBy adjusting the system energy, you explore how likely two particles are to interact. When passing through the resonance region, the probability increases significantly. This creates bent structures in the Dalitz distribution—when projected onto one axis, you see the characteristic resonance shape.\nThis example is particularly interesting because it shows resonances in all three particle pairs:\n\nHorizontal lines correspond to fixed K\\pi mass → K^* resonances\nVertical lines correspond to fixed proton-K\\pi mass → K-nucleon resonances\nDiagonal lines correspond to pion-proton combinations → \\Delta resonances\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dalitz plot density for three-body decays is: \n\\frac{d^2\\Gamma}{dm_{12}^2  dm_{23}^2} = \\text{constant} \\times |\\mathcal{M}|^2\n where m_{ij} are invariant masses and \\mathcal{M} is the decay amplitude. (see Figure~1)\n\n\n\nThe lines appear parallel to the sides of the Dalitz triangle:\n\nK^* resonances parallel to one side\n\\Lambda resonances parallel to another side\n\\Delta resonances parallel to the third side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The Dalitz plot, a representation of the phase-space for the three-body decay. (see Figure~6) It appears as an ellipse-shaped area where the internal region corresponds to allowed kinematics and the outside region is forbidden. On the x-axis lies the squared mass of two final-state particles, while the y-axis corresponds to the other subsystem. A horizontal line represents a slice of the phase-space with one mass fixed. The borders of the area correspond to configurations where all three momenta are aligned in the rest frame of the decaying particle, or equivalently, where the scattering angle in the relevant rest frame is either 0 or π.\n\n\n\nNow let’s examine angular distributions within resonance bands. When traversing phase space while keeping the mass combination fixed, you’re effectively changing the decay angle. This angle dependence reveals important physics:\n\nWithin a resonance band, probability can be inhomogeneous\nParticles often prefer aligned vs. perpendicular configurations\nThese preferences occur because intermediate resonances have spin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAngular distributions are powerful tools for measuring:\n\nSpin\nParity\nOther quantum numbers\n\n\n\n\nKey observations:\n\nHigher spin particles produce more structured angular distributions\nScalar particles produce no angular asymmetries\nThe number of nodes in angular distribution often equals the spin value\nFor spin-J particles: N_{\\text{states}} = 2J + 1 spin projections\n\nWhen dealing with particle spins, we need to understand how quantum states transform under rotations. For a particle with spin J, there are 2J+1 possible projections along a quantization axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Wigner D-function describes rotations using Euler angles (\\phi, \\theta, \\gamma): \nD^J_{m'm}(\\phi, \\theta, \\gamma) = e^{-i m' \\phi}  d^J_{m'm}(\\theta)  e^{-i m \\gamma}\n where d^J_{m'm}(\\theta) is the Wigner small d-matrix.\n\n\n\nRotation conventions in particle physics: 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: A diagram showing the spin projection. The horizontal line arrow indicates the z-axis, which is chosen as the quantization axis. The arrow denotes the particle spin, and its projection onto the axis is represented by m in the equations.\n\n\n\nRotate by \\phi about Z-axis\n\nRotate by \\theta about Y-axis\nRotate by \\gamma about Z-axis again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe careful with conventions! Mathematica uses opposite sign conventions compared to standard particle physics. Wikipedia and Python’s sympy library are reliable references.\n\n\n\nLet’s construct a model for three-body decays via cascade processes: initial particle → intermediate resonance X → particles 1 + 2, plus particle 3.\n![A unitary diagram for the three-body decay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: A dynamic diagram of a cascade decay, where particle 0 decays to a three-body final state through an intermediate state x that sequentially decays into particles 1 and 2. (see Figure~6) The intermediate particle carries spin j and serves as an expansion term of the full amplitude, known as the partial projection term. Lines represent initial and final state particles, while the double line denotes the intermediate particle.\n\n\n\nThe arrows show the initial and final state particles, and the blob stands for the interaction that transforms the initial state into the final state.](2024-Lecture-05-images/fig1.png)\nThe general cascade decay amplitude structure:\n\nA_{\\lambda_0, \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3}(s, \\theta) = \\sum_{\\lambda'_X} H^X_{\\lambda_0 \\lambda'_X} D^{j_X}_{\\lambda'_X \\lambda_X}(\\theta_X, \\phi_X) H^Y_{\\lambda_X \\lambda_Y} D^{j_Y}_{\\lambda_Y \\lambda_3}(\\theta_Y, \\phi_Y)\n\nComponent breakdown:\n\nH factors: Contain dynamics from strong/weak/EM interactions\nD functions: Handle rotational kinematics and angular distributions\n\\lambda_i: Helicity projections along particle directions of motion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the helicity formalism, we quantize spins along the direction of motion, making \\lambda_i the helicity projections.\n\n\n\nSpecial case: aligned kinematics (\\Phi = \\theta = 0)\n\nRotation matrices simplify significantly\nMany summations collapse due to delta functions\nFinal expression becomes much cleaner:\n\nThe simplified amplitude becomes: \n\\mathcal{A} = H_0 D(\\theta)^{J_X}_{\\lambda_X, \\lambda_0 + \\lambda_3} D(\\theta)^{\\lambda_0 + \\lambda_3}_{\\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2}\n\nKey insight: Angular distributions are determined primarily by rotational group properties, with only the production preferences coming from specific interactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: A kinematic configuration for the introduction of the helicity matrix in the transition of particle x decaying into particles 1 and 2. The representation is drawn in the rest frame of particle x, shown as a dot at rest, with arrows representing the three-momenta of particles 1 and 2 in this frame.\n\n\n\nThis separation makes angular analysis a powerful model-independent tool for determining particle properties.\n\n\n6.4 Angular Distributions and Partial Wave Analysis\nHow many numbers do I need in order to compute electromagnetic interactions or gravity? Specifically, to predict the angular distribution, what input parameters are required? The current framework appears to miss some fundamental components.\nWhat is inside these interaction vertices or amplitude blocks? To predict all observable values, I need the transition amplitudes for different spin configurations.\nThe number of independent amplitudes is given by the spin degeneracy factor: (2j_1 + 1)(2j_2 + 1) where j_1 and j_2 are the spins of the particles involved. These amplitude values might also be functions of particle masses, particularly the masses of the intermediate states.\nA similar number of parameters is needed for the final state amplitudes, but there are reasonable approximation methods available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn experimental analysis, we often make the initial assumption that these amplitude coefficients are constant, representing fundamental particle properties rather than dynamic functions. This simplification allows us to compute angular distributions without knowing the detailed internal dynamics.\n\n\n\nWith this constant amplitude assumption, I can compute the angular distribution while fixing the mass parameters and intensity normalization.\nThe differential decay rate with respect to \\cos\\theta is given by: \\frac{d\\Gamma}{d\\cos\\theta} \\propto |\\mathcal{M}|^2\nUsing \\cos\\theta rather than \\theta itself is preferable because it has a simpler Jacobian—we avoid the \\sin\\theta factor that appears in the \\theta distribution. The matrix element squared |\\mathcal{M}|^2 is typically treated as constant in this approximation.\nThe angular distribution spans from \\cos\\theta = -1 to \\cos\\theta = 1:\n\nA flat distribution indicates isotropic decay\nFor particles with spin, we often observe parabolic distributions (second-order polynomials in \\cos\\theta)\nOther characteristic patterns may appear depending on the spin structure\n\nIt’s crucial to recognize that A represents the quantum transition amplitude—a complex-valued quantity that gets squared to give the observed probability. In experiments, we only measure the squared magnitude of amplitudes.\nFor unpolarized decays, the distributions are averaged over initial spin projections and summed over final spin projections: \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} \\propto \\frac{1}{(2s_1+1)(2s_2+1)} \\sum_{\\text{spins}} |\\mathcal{M}|^2\nWhen analyzing experimental data, we don’t initially guess the amplitude form directly. Instead, we project the angular distributions onto orthogonal polynomials, particularly Legendre polynomials: \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\cos\\theta} = \\sum_{\\ell=0}^{L_{\\text{max}}} a_\\ell P_\\ell(\\cos\\theta)\nThis Legendre polynomial basis connects directly to the spins of the produced particles, forming the foundation of:\n\nPartial wave analysis: Modeling cross sections with amplitude parameters to learn about internal dynamics\nMoment analysis: Projecting differential cross sections onto polynomial moments\n\nThe initial projection onto polynomials doesn’t directly reveal the internal amplitude structure but provides combinations of these parameters that can be measured experimentally.\nThis approach isn’t straightforward, and we’ll have more opportunities to discuss it in detail. We’ve only briefly touched on the differences between canonical states (defined in the rest frame) and helicity states introduced later.\nFor comprehensive coverage of this subject, I recommend Martin Spearman’s Elementary Particle Theory, particularly Chapter 4, which covers:\n\nLorentz group fundamentals\nVector construction methods\nAccessible group theory applications\nParticle state definitions\n\nThe chapter provides substantial insights without overwhelming mathematical complexity.\nExercise Assignment: I will distribute Dalitz plots from CLEO and BaBar experiments with removed particle labels.

    "section": "8 Gauge Transformations",
    "text": "8 Gauge Transformations\nGo to the next portion — the Rancho Kinemic picture.\nWhile I’m cleaning the board, let me ask questions about this point.\nWe discussed the Lagrangian and equations of motion. Let’s discuss gauge transformation and gauge symmetry — an extremely important concept in field theory.\nWe’ll only touch on this briefly since we’re not doing field theory, but it’s really important you know where legs grow from it.\nSomething very familiar from quantum mechanics is the phase ambiguity of the wave function. We can update the phase, and the absolute square of the wave function won’t change because you multiply \\psi to \\psi^* and the phase drops out.\nThis is fine. First is to acknowledge that this should be a symmetry of our theory — we should be allowed to make this phase transformation.\nIt’s kind of by definition, so this overall phase you don’t even have to think about.\nThe problem appears when you demand your theory to be invariant under changes of phase at all possible space-time points simultaneously with different phases.\nWhat if I want to adjust my wave function at every space point?\nWhy is this a problem? Because in our equation of motion, in our Lagrangian — let me just write the Dirac part: \\bar{\\psi}D_\\mu\\gamma^\\mu\\psi.\nHere I have a term \\partial_\\mu\\psi, and this term becomes \\partial_\\mu\\psi' which is \\partial_\\mu(e^{i\\alpha(x)}\\psi).\nLet me take the derivative. This equals applying the derivative to the first term and then to the second term.\nWhen I apply it to the second term, I just have \\partial_\\mu\\psi. When I apply it to the first term, I get \\partial_\\mu acting on this — the exponent stays, but I have to take the derivative of the exponent.\nSo there’s an extra term. Indeed, the same equation won’t hold for \\psi'. It doesn’t transform to the same equation because the derivative yields another term with \\partial_\\mu\\alpha.\nThis means that local gauge transformation is not a symmetry of the free Lagrangian of the free moving Dirac particle.\nYou cannot adjust phase independently at different points for a free particle.\nIn simple words, this means the theory is incomplete. It only becomes complete if you consider radiation, photons, and charged particles together.\nOnce you look at the full Lagrangian (I think I get a minus here — that’s an exercise in field theory), you update simultaneously the phase of the field \\psi and the electromagnetic field A.\nThen you see that the additional term appearing in the covariant derivative D_\\mu will cancel exactly the one you get from the phase.\nThen the Lagrangian stays the same with the updated fields \\psi and A.\nThis fact led us to the D_\\mu term. Actually, writing D_\\mu minus or plus — was it plus before or minus? That’s correct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe covariant derivative in QED is: D_\\mu = \\partial_\\mu - ieA_\\mu This ensures local U(1) gauge invariance by canceling the extra terms from phase transformations, with e being the electromagnetic coupling constant."

They have to interact with strength g.\nThe structure is very simple. Again, this is a scalar quantity.\nYou can figure out and convince yourself that the same integral is a scalar quantity.

    "section": "10 Extending to Other Theories",
    "text": "10 Extending to Other Theories\nNow we’ll take this idea and move from QED to QCD.\nBefore jumping to QCD, where we deal with wave functions in three dimensions, let’s consider wave functions in the space of two coordinates — the case for weak interaction.\nFor weak interaction, you have up components and down components. Remember how the weak charge for quarks was +1/2 or -1/2 — the same range.\nHere you have an up field and down field. Remember, it’s still a fermion, so they have hidden four spinor components (we don’t talk about that).\nIn that case, the transformation that updates the phase is more general.\nWhat we want is that the update happening here doesn’t change the observable. Our observable will be \\psi^\\dagger\\psi.\nG or the matrix that updates the field — \\psi is the 2 \\times 2 matrix, and it’s unitary because observables should not change.\nIn this case, we’re dealing with transformations that are unitary, described by unitary matrices spanning the class called the U(2) group.\nWe’ll also fix the determinant of this matrix to be 1, and then this S comes from — for all matrices with determinant equal to 1 and unitary, they can be represented as an exponent.\nWho has seen the exponent of a matrix before? If you saw, what is this? Can you tell me what I should write here and then V?\nThis is more complicated. As soon as I put here one, it gets a little bit…\nWe solved it last year, right? I think it’s either 1 or 1 - e something. So e to 1, 1, 10 gets more complicated.\n\n10.1 Matrix Exponentiation and Generators in SU(N) Groups\nExactly right. So the approach is to take the expansion and perform multiple matrix multiplications.\nI recall it’s either e^{1} or 1 - e, but here, this is certainly not zero — and in fact, I’m not entirely sure about that anyway — so you understand what I’m referring to.\nThis is matrix exponentiation, and you can represent any element of the SU(2) group using matrix exponentiation. Here, we have a 2 \\times 2 matrix with zero trace. That condition comes from the determinant: \n\\det(U) = e^{\\mathrm{Tr}(\\alpha)} = 1\n which implies the trace of \\alpha must be zero.\nIn fact, there are only three matrices that span the entire basis of such traceless matrices: the Pauli matrices. These are called the generators of the group because they generate any group element.\nOnce we identify these three generators, we can take any three real numbers \\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, compute the combination -i\\alpha_j \\sigma_j, exponentiate it, and obtain an element of SU(2) — and in fact, this spans the entire group. You need to know the generator matrices — they’re fixed — then provide three numbers, and I can plug them into a Python routine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny element of SU(2) can be written as: \nU = e^{-i \\alpha_j \\sigma_j}\n where \\sigma_j are the Pauli matrices and \\alpha_j are real parameters.\n\n\n\nIs there a reason we fix the determinant to 1? Yes — because we’re working with SU(2). In general, \nU(N) = U(1) \\times SU(N)\n So U(2) is U(1) × SU(2). The U(1) part is just a simple scalar phase, while SU(2) contains the non-trivial matrix structure. The scalar phase behaves exactly as in the 2D case, but the SU(2) matrix gives something interesting.\nSo I see the relationship, but why do we fix the determinant? Because SU(2) is one of the standard groups — we know a lot about it. If we considered U(2) instead, we’d have more generators and greater complexity. SU(2) is one of the primary elementary groups — that’s the main reason. We know everything about SU(2): how many generators it has, its matrix structure — it’s a nice object to work with.\nThis factorization helps us proceed similarly for higher groups: \nU(3) = U(1) \\times SU(3)\n We factor out the phase, and what remains is the standard group SU(3), which we use to describe the global update of the wave function with the same components. This is exactly what we deal with in quantum chromodynamics (QCD).\nWhen dealing with color charge, we don’t have two components — we have three: red, blue, and green. The transformation is then a 3 \\times 3 matrix with an overall phase — that’s not too complicated. We’ve discussed this before.\nBut then there’s a non-trivial contribution where you update your fields significantly. These are 3 \\times 3 matrices with determinant equal to 1. Again, you can relate this to the matrix exponential, and the exponent must be traceless.\nThe basis of traceless matrices in three dimensions that satisfy the anti-commutation properties — should I say the output must be anti-Hermitian? Does it hold for our condition? We insert it, multiply by two, and get -i\\alpha, then move to the other part.\nIf you look at the basis in two dimensions for traceless matrices, you get three generators; in three dimensions, you get eight. The number of generators is related to the number of charge carriers in the field.\nIn fact, we identify each generator matrix with the action of the field because they appear in the interaction term. The interaction term includes this matrix: every time you attach the field \\psi and the interaction field A, it comes together with this generator matrix.\nTo connect this back: remember where this chunk came from? We were computing derivatives and found an extra derivative for the phase. This extra derivative led us to introduce an extended derivative of the field — an interaction term that appears in Feynman diagrams.\nAs soon as we deal with higher dimensions, the same derivative we compute will come together with the appropriate matrix. So \\alpha is now 2 \\times 2, and it will appear here as another matrix. These generator matrices — \\sigma for SU(2), or \\lambda for SU(3) — will appear in the interaction vertex.\nWe find that:\n\nFor SU(2): 3 generators → 3 charge carriers: Z, W^+, W^-\nFor SU(3): 8 generators → 8 gluons\n\nUnfortunately, we lack the imagination to name all eight gluons properly, but they are identified by their matrices.\nIn the case of weak interaction, one matrix is diagonal in the space — roughly corresponding to the Z boson. The W and Z are charged similarly to the gluon field; some will be diagonal, and we identify certain extra hypercharges for the states. Some will behave like W_2, W^+, depending on the matrix.\nYou’ll see the same matrices in homework exercises. Think of them as the eight different gluons — you can name them, and they act differently on the field. They appear in the interaction vertex depending on the flavor of the gluon interacting with the quark. Each vertex behaves differently, driven by the structure of the Pauli matrices or their generalizations.\nThat’s why it’s a good exercise to think about this interaction term: How does this become a skewer? How do we contract the color charge? It’s a big, old puzzle.\nNow, the last part: I have two more topics. Confinement is important to discuss, so let me say a few words about it, and then we’ll go through the basic equations quickly.\nConfinement is the property of the theory where the strong interaction grows with distance. Unlike electromagnetic interactions, which decrease with distance, the strong interaction governing color charge increases when you pull quarks apart. This confines quarks to small scales.\nThe only way to feel the strong interaction is to zoom in to the smallest objects: mesons and baryons. Let’s draw them again:\n\nThis is a meson\nThis is a baryon\n\nThe word “confined” means that the strong interaction exists only inside the bubble of the meson or baryon. There is no strong interaction outside. If you try to pull them apart with huge force, at some point they divide — but then the resulting objects are again color-neutral, confined, and travel as stable particles.\nColor neutral means having zero charge with respect to the strong interaction. Remember: as soon as a particle has color charge, gluons can interact with it — meaning it’s not confined. Therefore, matter forms into these little bubbles where strong interactions are active inside, but outside they don’t feel the strong field — they are color neutral.\nI’m not deriving this — I’m stating it as a fact of the theory, proven by the existence of life as we know it. Confinement plays a vital role in binding and making life possible.\nHowever, if you look at the Lagrangian — where did our Lagrangian go? — you can’t directly see that it’s a confined theory. There are indications of confinement in the Lagrangian, and one of them is the gluon self-interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Diagrams of gluon self-interactions arising from the gauge part of the Lagrangian. These illustrate the non-Abelian nature of QCD and provide the basis for color confinement.\n\n\n\nIn QED, we had photon terms; in QCD, we have G_\\mu terms like: \nG_\\mu G_\\nu - G_\\nu G_\\mu + f^{abc} G_\\nu G_\\nu\n and then G_\\mu G_\\mu with 3-gluon and 4-gluon terms. These manifest in interaction vertices like this and this — called gluon self-interactions.\nGluon self-interaction is one indication of confinement — not a proof, but a clue. People study all possible field theories; some have confinement, some don’t. Confinement remains one of the great unsolved problems — there’s even a prize waiting for whoever can explain it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe running coupling \\alpha_s(Q) depends on the momentum transfer Q:\n\nAsymptotic freedom: \\alpha_s(Q) \\to 0 as Q \\to \\infty\nConfinement: \\alpha_s(Q) grows large at low Q (around 1 GeV)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Running of the strong coupling \\alpha_s(Q) with momentum transfer Q. At high Q, the coupling decreases, showing asymptotic freedom; at low Q \\lesssim 1 GeV, the coupling grows large, marking the confinement region.\n\n\n\nWe define Q as the momentum with which we probe the hadron. What we experience is the effective strong coupling \\alpha_s^{\\text{eff}}. You can think of a gluon coming in, interacting with a quark, and a lot happening — effectively, one quantum bubble with an effective interaction strength that depends on the gluon’s momentum.\nThis gluon, depending on its energy, will experience different interaction strengths. In electromagnetic interactions, we discuss screening effects; here, the effective interaction depends on Q as follows:\n\nIf Q is very high, we’re in the regime of asymptotic freedom\nIf Q is low, we’re in the regime of confinement\n\nThe transition happens around 1 GeV. Hadrons live in the low-Q region.\nIf you think about it: these particles talk to each other, exchange gluons, and the gluon couples to the fermion. When they’re close together, the gluon momentum is small — below 1 GeV — and that’s where the interaction is super strong. Meanwhile, at very high momentum transfer, the coupling becomes small — that’s asymptotic freedom, which we’ll discuss more later.\n\n\n10.2 Nuclear Binding and Decay Fundamentals\nI notice you’ve provided detailed instructions and examples for editing lecture transcripts, but you haven’t included the actual nuclear physics lecture transcription that needs to be polished.\nThe helping material contains several relevant nuclear physics formulas that could be integrated if they appear in your transcript:\nKey Nuclear Physics Formulas:\n\nNuclear Binding Energy: Calculates the energy equivalent of the mass defect: B(Z,A) = [Zm_p + (A-Z)m_n - m_{\\text{nucleus}}]c^2\nSemi-Empirical Mass Formula: Approximates binding energy based on the liquid drop model: B(Z,A) = a_V A - a_S A^{2/3} - a_C \\frac{Z(Z-1)}{A^{1/3}} - a_A \\frac{(A-2Z)^2}{A} + \\delta(A,Z)\nRadioactive Decay Law: Follows exponential decay: N(t) = N_0e^{-\\lambda t}\nRutherford Scattering: Describes angular distribution: \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\left(\\frac{Z_1Z_2e^2}{8\\pi\\epsilon_0E}\\right)^2 \\frac{1}{\\sin^4(\\theta/2)}\nUniverse Evolution Timeline: Includes key phases:\nt \\sim 10^{-12} seconds: Quark-Gluon Plasma\nt \\sim 1 second: Big Bang nucleosynthesis begins\nQuark Charge Properties:\nUp-type quarks (u, c, t): Electric charge +\\frac{2}{3}\nDown-type quarks (d, s, b): Electric charge -\\frac{1}{3}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese formulas represent fundamental concepts in nuclear and particle physics that might appear in your lecture transcript.

    "text": "1 Isospin and Hadron Classification\nWelcome everyone to today’s lecture. It will be mostly about classification of hadrons. I will walk you a little bit through the history of how important discoveries were made and what we learned from there about the hadrons and how we can group them together.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, there were a lot of new big accelerators built, like for example the Bevatron. It came into operation in 1954. It was a proton accelerator with energies of up to 13 GeV. These high energy protons were then shot at a fixed target, and a lot of different particles were produced and detected. They found over 100 new particles, which was then called the particle zoo. Physicists of the time had to think about how to organize these particles: is there some pattern? Are these all fundamental particles? This is what we will be talking about today.\nIf you think about the periodic table, for example, we had all these atoms and we were able to group them together according to their proton and neutron numbers. We knew how many electrons were in the outermost shells, which helped us to group them together in the periodic table. This is kind of what we want to do now with hadrons. In the context of particle physics or hadron physics, the characteristics that we choose to group them together are according to their quantum numbers. We will now discuss different quantum numbers and why they were introduced and how they helped us to group together certain particles.\n\n1.1 Isospin Introduction\nLet’s start with isospin. In 1932 the neutron was discovered, and different experiments showed that when we look into proton-proton interactions, proton-neutron interactions, or neutron-neutron interactions, they had a very similar interaction strength. If you look at the rate at which these interactions were taking place, then they were basically the same. Experiments showed that all of these had similar interaction strength. If you also look at the mass of the proton and neutron, it’s almost the same at 939 MeV. This led to the suggestion that we can consider proton and neutron to be the same particle, but to have two different states that it can occur in, described by the isospin.\nThis means that the strong interaction does not distinguish between proton and neutron. The only time when we know that there are different particles is in an electromagnetic field. We can describe them as the same particle, the nucleon, and put them into an isospin doublet:\nN = \\begin{pmatrix} p \\\\ n \\end{pmatrix}\nThis is an analog property like the spin: if you look at the electron, we can have either spin up or spin down. This is similar here. At the level of quarks, since protons and neutrons are composed of up and down quarks, this means that the strong interaction does not distinguish between up and down.\nThe strong interaction is not capable of distinguishing between the different flavors of down and up. We can write that the up quark has an isospin of I = \\frac{1}{2} with the third component I_3(u) = +\\frac{1}{2}, and the down quark with I_3(d) = -\\frac{1}{2}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe isospin quantum numbers for quarks are:\n\nUp quark: I_3(u) = +\\frac{1}{2}\nDown quark: I_3(d) = -\\frac{1}{2} For antiquarks, the signs are reversed: I_3(\\bar{u}) = -\\frac{1}{2} and I_3(\\bar{d}) = +\\frac{1}{2} to maintain consistent SU(2) transformation properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Mathematical Framework of Isospin\nIsospin is not exactly a property like the spin, but mathematically we can treat the isospin like the spin. It follows the SU(2) algebra. In the last lecture, you already heard a little bit about the SU(2) algebras. Let me remind you a couple of things. It holds for the matrices, and we can describe this as a rotation matrix. Here, these sigma matrices are just the Pauli matrices. For the isospin operator, it was the same as for the spin where you had J instead of an I.\nGenerally we write these states always with the isospin and then the third component: |I, I_3 \\rangle. If we apply, for example, the I_3 operator to up, then we just get the eigenvalue +\\frac{1}{2}. We have here the lowering operators. If you have the isospin I, then we can have different projections I_3 from I down to -I, so you have 2I + 1 projections. With these lowering operators, you can go from one projection to the next. If you apply this to a state, you get out the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\nThis is just to remind you how this SU(2) algebra works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe SU(2) isospin algebra follows these key relations:\n\nCommutation relations: [I_i, I_j] = i\\epsilon_{ijk}I_k\nLadder operators: I_\\pm = I_1 \\pm iI_2\nCasimir operator: I^2|I,I_3\\rangle = I(I+1)|I,I_3\\rangle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Meson Isospin Combinations\nNow let’s look at a couple of examples. For example, if you want to think about the up and down quarks: last time you heard that we can form mesons taking a quark and an antiquark. Let’s think about what kind of particles we can get if you combine up and down quarks with antiquarks for the mesons.\nIf you look here at the isospin, we have for both up and down quarks isospin \\frac{1}{2}. We combine \\frac{1}{2} with another \\frac{1}{2}. What can we get if we have two \\frac{1}{2} isospin particles? We can have isospin of 0 or 1, just like you’re used to in the spin. If you think about the dimensions here, we always have two projections for one half: +\\frac{1}{2} or -\\frac{1}{2}. This is the dimensions here: 2 \\times 2. To indicate that we have here an antiquark, I place this bar here on top.\nIf you have an isospin of 1, how many projections can we have for I_3? You can have 2I + 1 projections. For I = 1, you get three: +1, 0, -1. For I = 0, just zero. If you take these as dimensions, then you would get 3 + 1. This is how you would write it down according to group theory:\n\\mathbf{2} \\otimes \\mathbf{\\bar{2}} = \\mathbf{3} \\oplus \\mathbf{1}\nI will also discuss a little bit later how we can understand this in terms of matrices. Here basically you have a 4 \\times 4 matrix and then you can decompose it into two components: into a 3 \\times 3 and a 1 \\times 1 matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Excerpt of a Clebsch–Gordan coefficient table for the spin combination of 1/2 and 1/2. The table lists the coefficients used to couple two spin-1/2 particles into total spin states, showing how individual spin components combine to form singlet and triplet configurations.\n\n\n\nThis is a triplet isospin state and this is an isospin singlet. This is how these different states would look like written down in terms of up and down quarks and form mesons.\nNow I want to briefly discuss with you where these factors come from. Like in the case of spins, you can use Clebsch-Gordan coefficients if you combine two spins or two isospins to figure out what kind of signs and coefficients you have in front of them. I will just write down a small fraction of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. We are combining here either spin \\frac{1}{2} with \\frac{1}{2}. These are the isospins of the two particles that we want to combine, and these are then the projections, the I_3 components.\nI will write the one now on top. Here you can see the outcome: the new particles that you get out and below it you see the projection I_3 of this combination. We said we can have an isospin triplet with isospin 1, so we get here this one three times with the projection +1, 0, -1. We have here the singlet with zero and the projection zero. Then here we can see the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, and you also have to always take the square root. If you now look here, you can then see why these states look the way they do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe explicit wavefunctions for the pion triplet members are:\n\n|\\pi^+\\rangle = -|u\\bar{d}\\rangle\n|\\pi^0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|u\\bar{u}\\rangle - |d\\bar{d}\\rangle)\n|\\pi^-\\rangle = |d\\bar{u}\\rangle These come from Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining isospin-1/2 states.\n\n\n\n\nJust one more thing that I need to mention is that for the antiquarks we get I_3(\\bar{u}) = -\\frac{1}{2} and I_3(\\bar{d}) = +\\frac{1}{2}. This minus sign is chosen so the quarks and antiquarks behave in the same way when you apply SU(2) transformations. If you look here at the singlet, we get then from the up and anti-up we get this vector: we have these projections +\\frac{1}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}, so we get this vector with the square root. You do the same for down anti-down: you have -\\frac{1}{2}, +\\frac{1}{2}, you get here this minus sign, but because there’s also here this minus sign, it ends up being a plus. Then you do the same with the triplet one states. I just wanted to show you how it’s done, because we also practice this a lot more in the exercises.\nNow let’s take a step forward. I also wanted to mention what kind of particles we have here. This triplet typically pions: this would be a \\pi^+, this would be a \\pi^0, and here \\pi^-. We can also have rho particles: they’re basically the same, but there’s one thing that distinguishes these two, and that’s their spin. Here we have antiparallel spin, spin zero, and here they have parallel spin, but otherwise they’re the same. For the singlets we can have here an omega and here eta prime. Choosing this isospin quantum number, we can already group together some particles.\n\n\n1.4 Meson-Nucleon Systems and Baryons\nLet’s now go one step further and think about if you take for example a pion beam and shoot it on a proton target. We have a pion with isospin 1 and a nucleon target with isospin \\frac{1}{2}. What kind of isospin states can you get out of this? If you combine isospin 1 and isospin \\frac{1}{2}, you add this up. What do you guess? It’s either \\frac{3}{2} or \\frac{1}{2}.\nLet me write this properly. What are the dimensions here? For I = 1, we know it’s three: we have three different projections that are possible. For I = \\frac{1}{2}, we have two projections. Here we get four because we have \\pm\\frac{3}{2} and \\pm\\frac{1}{2}, and we get two again for \\frac{1}{2}. This is how you write this theory:\n\\mathbf{3} \\otimes \\mathbf{2} = \\mathbf{4} \\oplus \\mathbf{2}\nI also wanted to mention what this actually means, what we’re writing down. Basically we have here a 6 \\times 6 matrix and we can decompose it into matrices of the subspaces here: we have here a 2 \\times 2 matrix and here a 4 \\times 4 matrix. These are then called irreducible representations. This is basically what we do. For small numbers it’s kind of easy to know and write it down, but if you have larger numbers, there are some methods how you can figure this out. We will not discuss it in more depth, but I just wanted to mention what this actually means.\nIf you have isospin in SU(2), you get these four projections. This can be actually assigned to particles that were found at the time: these are called delta particles. We have \\Delta^{++}, \\Delta^+, \\Delta^0, \\Delta^-. They also give you the mass m_\\Delta = 1232\\text{ MeV}.\nI want to do one last example. Right now we have looked into meson systems and combining a meson and a nucleon system. What about if you just combine three quarks to get baryons? Then you would have basically 2 \\times 2 \\times 2: three quarks, and there are always two projections possible for \\pm\\frac{1}{2}. We can now use what we have already seen here: 2 \\times 2 gives us 3 + 1. (see Figure Figure 1) This is what we had before: \\mathbf{2} \\otimes \\mathbf{2} \\otimes \\mathbf{2} = \\mathbf{4} \\oplus \\mathbf{2} \\oplus \\mathbf{2}. This gives us four, eight: \\frac{3}{2} and we have here two out of spin doublets with isospin \\frac{1}{2}. ### Experimental Significance and Historical Context\nWhat is this good for in isospin? You will later also see in the exercises that we can actually use this quantum number to see why certain cross sections that were measured are of different sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Diagram showing the cross section on the y-axis and the mass on the x-axis, with two curves representing pπ⁺ and pπ⁻ interactions. A clear resonance peak appears at the Δ mass, indicating the formation of the Δ resonance during scattering.\n\n\n\nIf we take for example the cross section for \\pi^+ p and for \\pi^- p, if you look here in the delta mass region, you see that there is a factor of three difference: \\frac{\\sigma_{\\pi^+p}}{\\sigma_{\\pi^-p}} \\approx 3:1. You can figure out in the exercises and classwork why there are differences in the cross sections between the different reactions.\nI introduced this isospin concept for protons and neutrons. How was that in experiment? They also write like up and down quarks—that wasn’t there. This concept in the 1950s: how should you imagine this? They saw like, oh, well, you produce pions and rho—was it also there? Yes, they also found rho later on. They introduced this concept to find symmetries or something. They were first just looking for patterns that they could find between different particles. This was like purely mathematical looking: just how can we group these together?\nIf you take the isospin, then we can already group some of these particles together. Like I said, we can group the pions or the rhos into triplets. We can have the delta in an isospin quadruplet and things like this. Then later bigger patterns were also seen. That’s where this lecture is headed towards: we will look later next into the strangeness and then hypercharge and so on.\nThe reason why I’m asking is because if you look just at protons and neutrons, you might initially think, oh, you have spin and charge and that’s all they do. Why would you introduce isospin? But it’s only when you do these kinds of reactions: proton-proton, proton-neutron, and neutron-neutron, and if you see that the reaction rates are pretty much the same, then you can come to the conclusion: okay, maybe the strong interaction doesn’t care about whether it’s a proton or a neutron. That’s where the isospin idea came from.\nIt comes down to once you start to look at cross sections, you start to see that certain reactions are stronger and you need to introduce new concepts in the theory. Here it was actually that they are pretty much similar. If you look at these different experiments and you see that the strong interaction does not seem to care about whether it’s a proton or a neutron, on quark level it means then it doesn’t care about up or down quark. That’s why we also placed not just the proton and neutron into an isospin doublet, but also the up and down quarks."

    "text": "2 The Eightfold Way and Quark Model\nSo first, physicists had this kind of an isospin doublet. They found all these other particles like the pions and kaons and grouped them together, then looked for bigger patterns with also the strangeness included as the next quantum number.\nAround the 1960s, with the Bevatron experiment and large accelerators accessible, they found over 100 particles and didn’t know what to do with them. They later found out we can actually decompose them into smaller particles to understand how, and we are still trying to understand.\nSome particles detected behaved in a strange manner. For example, in cosmic rays with pions going to a carbon target, they could see in a cloud chamber four tracks which look like a V: $ ^+ $, $ ^- $, proton, and $ ^- $.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A π⁻ from cosmic rays collides with a proton, initiating decay chains involving several intermediate particles. The π⁻ decays into a K⁰ and a Λ⁰, which subsequently decay into π⁻π⁺ and pπ⁻ respectively, illustrating hadronic decay processes.\n\n\n\nThese particles always appeared in pairs and had a fairly long lifetime.\nThey concluded by introducing a new quantum number strangeness and said that it needs to be conserved. Isospin is also a quantum number conserved in strong interactions.\nHow do we assign this quantum number? Particles consisting of up and down quarks have strangeness $ S = 0 $, for example pion, neutron, proton. Particles with strangeness $ S = +1 $ include lambda, and in general these are called hyperons. There are different types of hyperons like lambda, sigmas, cascades, and kaons.\nWith this we can form two isospin doublets with $ K^+ $ and $ K^0 $, and similarly $ K^- $ and $ {K^0} $ in an isospin doublet with strangeness $ S = -1 $. They figured since these two come always in pairs that this quantum number needs to be conserved in strong interaction, but it is not conserved in weak interaction.\nLooking at the lambda decay $ p + ^- $, both products don’t have strangeness but this decay can happen. (see Figure Figure 3) From the long lifetime this means weak decay. They are produced in strong interaction because we have $ + p p + K^+ $ and $ n $ hypercharge.\nHypercharge $ Y $ is given by baryon number $ B $ and strangeness number $ S $: $ Y = B + S $. For baryon number, if it’s a baryon then it gets $ B = +1 $, if it’s an antibaryon then $ B = -1 $, and if it’s a meson then $ B = 0 $.\nWe can’t have certain reactions. For example, if here we didn’t have a lambda but a proton, then this would not happen. Same way here, if you have lambda then we can’t have a $ $ in here. This always comes in pairs, so the strangeness number is conserved.\nAlso if you have $ ^- $ in a proton beam, then you can’t have suddenly in the end two mesons only. There needs to be a baryon as well, so the baryon number is conserved.\nFrom isospin, we had the isospin triplet with projections $ +1 $, $ 0 $, and $ -1 $ correlating to charge: $ -1 $ for $ ^- $, $ 0 $ for $ ^0 $, and $ +1 $ for $ ^+ $. There seems to be a relationship between isospin and charge.\nThis is what Gell-Mann and Nishijima calculation tells us: the charge can be expressed as the third component of the isospin plus the hypercharge divided by two: $ Q = I_3 + $.\nLet’s check this formula:\n\nFor proton, $ I = $ and $ I_3 = + $. Hypercharge: strangeness $ S = 0 $ for proton, but it’s a baryon so $ B = 1 $, giving $ Y = 1 $. Using the relation, charge $ Q = + = +1 $, as expected.\nFor neutron, $ I_3 = - $, $ Y = 1 $, giving $ Q = - + = 0 $.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Formulas:\n\nGell-Mann–Nishijima Formula: $ Q = I_3 + $ relates electric charge to isospin and hypercharge\nHypercharge Definition: $ Y = B + S $ combines baryon number and strangeness\nConservation Laws: $ B_{} = B_{} $ and $ S_{} = S_{} $ (strong interactions only)\n\n\n\n\nUsing strangeness and/or hypercharge in combination with isospin, Gell-Mann and Ne’eman found a much larger pattern for these particles. They can be arranged in bigger multiplets, called the eightfold way.\nFor these larger patterns they looked not just at the up and down quark, but also included the strange quark. Now we are in the SU(3) flavor symmetry. At the time they didn’t know these different quarks existed, but we are just going to look at it in this way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Diagram plotting the z-component of isospin on the x-axis and strangeness (S) on the y-axis. An inverted triangle connects the up, down, and strange quarks, with each vertex labeled by its corresponding quantum numbers, visualizing the quark model’s flavor structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Diagram with strangeness on the y-axis and the third component of isospin on the x-axis, showing the baryon octet. Each vertex of the hexagonal arrangement represents a baryon with its quark composition, demonstrating SU(3) flavor symmetry.\n\n\n\nPlotting the third component of isospin against strangeness for the up, down, and strange quarks, let’s write down the quantum numbers:\n\nFor baryon number each gets $ $ because up, up, down gives total $ 1 $\nCharge for up is $ + $, for down is $ - $\nThey’re all fermions with spin $ $\nStrangeness for strange quark is $ -1 $\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Depiction of a baryon decuplet multiplet including Ω⁻, Ξ⁻, Ξ⁰, Σ⁻, Σ⁰, Σ*⁺, and the four Δ states (Δ⁻, Δ⁰, Δ⁺, Δ⁺⁺). Diagonals denote electric charge (Q) and horizontal lines indicate strangeness, with mass differences of roughly 150 MeV between each level.\n\n\n\nNow looking at bigger patterns for baryons. Baryons are composed of three quarks from up, down, or strange: $ = $. This gives a decuplet and octets. We look at ground state variants arranged into an octet and decuplet.\nPlotting third component of isospin against strangeness (or hypercharge), we have $ S = 0, -1, -2 $.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Meson octet diagram showing K⁰, K⁺, π⁻, η, π⁰, π⁺, K⁻, and K̄⁰. The y-axis represents strangeness, the x-axis represents the third component of isospin, and diagonal lines indicate electric charge (Q), highlighting SU(3) meson symmetry.\n\n\n\nOn the horizontal axis are isospin multiplets: isospin doublet for neutron and proton, triplet for sigmas, doublet for cascades.\nPointing out positions: here is $ I_3 = +, - $, here $ I_3 = 0 $, here $ S = -1 $.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Table listing the u, d, and s quarks along with their fundamental quantum numbers. Entries include baryon number (B), electric charge (Q), spin, strangeness (S), isospin (I), z-component of isospin (I₃), and hypercharge (Y).\n\n\n\nYou can see quark content: here all with one strange quark, here with two strange quarks.\nLooking at masses:\n\nProton and neutron masses are almost the same, difference about 1 MeV\nSimilar for isospin partners\nBut in vertical direction, mass difference is much larger: sigma mass difference about 250 MeV, here to here about 130 MeV\n\nThis tells us that isospin symmetry in SU(2) is a good symmetry, but including strange quark it’s pretty much broken. It’s only an approximate symmetry because otherwise we would have same masses for all.\nWorking out the pattern: upper row has data, down here only minus. On this axis highest third component, along this axis strangeness $ 0, -1, -2 $.\nAll these particles have spin in common. Baryons in octet have spin $ $ and parity $ + $. For decuplet, spin $ $ and parity $ + $. Here spins can be aligned or permutations giving $ $, here all aligned.\nWhen this pattern was found, the $ ^- $ was not yet discovered. This was a big success to predict its existence, found two years later in bubble chamber experiments with $ K^- + p ^- + K^+ + K^0 $. For strangeness conservation, we need two more kaons.\n$ ^- $ decays into cascade $ ^- $, then further to $ ^0 + ^0 $, $ ^0 $, and $ p + ^- $. Not only predicted existence but roughly predicted mass: looking at masses between horizontal lines, $ $ mass 1232 MeV, sigmas, then $ ^- $ mass around 1680 MeV, with mass spacing roughly 150 MeV.\nAll these considerations come from group theory, mathematical descriptions of particles with symmetry considerations. Difference between masses in octet and decuplet is that spin is different, so mass difference accounted to spin-spin or spin-orbit interactions from dynamics. For mesons, with up, down, strange quarks, $ {} = $. On diagonal you have charge: here all charge $ -1 $, middle charge $ 0 $, $ +1 $, $ +2 $. This octet or nonet including $ ’ $ has quantum numbers $ 0^-+ $. (see Figure Figure 7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Vector meson octet including ρ⁻, ω, ρ⁰, ρ⁺, and the K* mesons with charges 0, +, −, and anti-0. The diagram mirrors the pseudoscalar meson octet structure, illustrating similar flavor symmetry among vector mesons.\n\n\n\nThis means quark-antiquark pair have anti-parallel spins, parity $ - $. For spins aligned parallel, spin $ 1 $, parity $ -1 $, charge conjugation $ C $. Parity inverts spatial coordinates, charge conjugation converts particle to antiparticle.\nFor baryons, if you know orbital angular momentum $ L $, parity $ P = (-1)^L $. For octet ground states $ L = 0 $, parity $ + $ for $ ^+ $ and $ ^+ $. For mesons, $ P = (-1)^{L+1} $, giving $ - $ for both. Charge conjugation well-defined for neutral mesons, e.g., $ ^0 $ has $ C = +1 $. (see Figure Figure 3)\nFor decays, parity and C parity are multiplicative. Combining spins of different particles to get total spin. Example: can $ $ meson decay into two pions? For $ ^0 $, $ C = +1 $, multiplied gives $ +1 $, but for $ $, $ C = -1 $, so cannot happen.\nLastly, consider quark content for $ ^- $ or $ ^{++} $. All spins aligned, flavor content same. With Pauli exclusion principle for fermions, they should be distinguishable by one quantum number. Looking at total wave function: spatial, spin, and flavor.\nFor $ L = 0 $, spatial wave function symmetric. Spins all aligned up, symmetric. Flavor all same, symmetric. Physicists introduced new quantum number: color charge. This part of wave function must be antisymmetric to get total antisymmetric wave function. (see Figure Figure 8) Assign each quark different color: red, green, blue.\n\n\n\nA step-like diagram with energy ω (in GeV) on the x-axis, showing three discrete levels corresponding to accessible quark flavors. The steps mark quark sets (u,d,s), (u,d,s,c), and (u,d,s,c,b,t), each annotated with example hadrons, providing evidence for the existence of color charge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParity Formulas:\n\nBaryons: $ P = (-1)^L $ (ground states have $ L = 0 $, $ P = + $)\nMesons: $ P = (-1)^{L+1} $ (ground states have $ L = 0 $, $ P = - $)\nMultiplet Decompositions:\n\nBaryons: $ = $\nMesons: $ {} = $\n\n\n\n\n\nBriefly discuss experiment showing three colors. Looked into $ e^+ e^- $ annihilation with virtual photon exchanged, producing different particles: quark-antiquark pairs or leptons like $ ^+ ^- $.\nMeasured ratio $ R = $. For leptons no color, so dividing gives proportionality to number of colors. Photon vertex proportional to charge squared, different quark types. (see Figure Figure 4)\nInitially up, down, strange quarks measured as peaks in spectrum (rho, omega, pi mesons). When energy high enough, produce charm-anticharm bound states (J/ψ), then B bar states. Calculated steps show number of colors should be three.\nThis was historical background on how from detected particles, patterns were seen using eightfold way strangeness, later forming quark model where particles consist of smaller quarks with six flavors and three colors."

    "text": "3 Unraveling Strange Particles and Quantum Numbers\nGenerally, what I always find difficult with histories like what is known versus what’s not known relates back to my previous question about particle identification methods.\nI should have perhaps asked this earlier when you introduced strangeness in the context of cosmic rays.\n\n3.1 Particle Identification Through Invariant Mass\nThe fundamental practical question is: how do you distinguish kaons from other particles using just invariant masses? (see Figure Figure 3) (see Figure ?@fig-fg10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvariant Mass Formula: M^2 = \\left(\\sum E_i\\right)^2 - \\left(\\sum \\vec{p}_i\\right)^2 This relativistic invariant allows identification of particle resonances from decay products. (see Figure Figure 2) When analyzing cosmic ray events with protons and pions, peaks in the invariant mass spectrum reveal new particles like kaons.\n\n\n\nYou can only look at the invariant mass in these cases. You detect the proton and the pions, then examine the spectra to identify what’s known versus unknown.\n\n\n3.2 Historical Discovery Timeline and Strange Particles\nThese particles were called “strange” because researchers were confused about why they only appeared in pairs and had longer lifetimes than other particles. (see Figure Figure 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrangeness Conservation: \\Delta S = 0 This quantum number explains why strange particles (like kaons) are always produced in pairs and have unexpectedly long lifetimes. Violation occurs only through weak interactions.\n\n\n\nThe pions were discovered relatively quickly after fundamental particles:\n\nProtons were known early\nNeutrons discovered in 1932\nLater in the 1950s: antiprotons and many other particles emerged\n\nSince many are charged, you can measure them directly.\n\n\n3.3 Conservation Laws and Quantum Numbers\nYou mentioned C-parity - how was that introduced? Was it used to say certain decays aren’t allowed? (see Figure ?@fig-fg10)\nActually, I think it worked the other way around: researchers observed that certain decays weren’t measured, suggesting some quantum number must be violated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharge Conjugation (C-parity): C|\\psi\\rangle = \\eta_C|\\psi\\rangle C-parity describes how particles transform into their antiparticles under charge conjugation, providing selection rules for decays.\n\n\n\nI don’t know exactly when charge conjugation was introduced, but it emerged when people started thinking systematically about particles and antiparticles - directly with the positron in the 1930s, before the antiproton discovery.\nThis highlights the difficulty: sometimes concepts come from theory, sometimes from experiments. It’s interesting how the omega baryon was predicted, but also how quantum numbers were introduced based on cross-section measurements. ### Quark Model Development and Mass Patterns (see Figure ?@fig-fg11)\nHistorically, the multiplets were mostly correct - I only added the quark content for clarity. When multiplets were assembled, researchers postulated there might be smaller substructure, initially called “partons” before becoming “quarks.” (see Figure Figure 2) (see Figure ?@fig-fg10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuark Model Mass Relations: M(\\Omega^-) - M(\\Xi^*) \\approx M(\\Xi^*) - M(\\Sigma^*) \\approx M(\\Sigma^*) - M(\\Delta) \\approx 150\\text{ MeV} The regular mass spacing in baryon multiplets provided crucial evidence for the quark model, suggesting these particles differ by replacing one quark with a heavier strange quark.\n\n\n\nThe mass differences already indicated there should be different quark content in these particles - for the deltas, sigmas, cascades, and so on. Researchers observed these mass differences and reasoned that the last undetected particle would also have approximately 150 MeV more mass than the others, which turned out to be correct.\nThe original quark paper is remarkably brief - just two pages - so you can easily look up how they introduced the concept.\nIt was an exciting time: they predicted the omega-minus in the quark model, and it was experimentally detected and discovered in 1964.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOmega-Minus Discovery: K^- + p \\to \\Omega^- + K^+ + K^0 This was the experimental reaction that discovered the \\Omega^- particle, confirming quark model predictions."
