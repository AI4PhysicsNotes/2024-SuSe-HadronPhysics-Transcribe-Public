## Automation

The lecture index is automatically generated based on the actual Markdown files present in the repository. Missing lectures are shown as gray, unclickable buttons.

### Local Development

To regenerate the index locally:
```bash
python3 generate_index.py
```

The index will be generated as `Lectures/index.html` with buttons for all available lectures and gray placeholders for missing ones.
