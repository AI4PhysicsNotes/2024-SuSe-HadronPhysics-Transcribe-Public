I’m skipping the explicit summation over \\mu from 1 to 4, and also over \\nu, which also appears twice.\nNow, F_{\\mu\\nu} is actually a matrix: \\mu is 4-dimensional and \\nu is 4-dimensional, so F_{\\mu\\nu} is a 4 \\times 4 matrix.\nYou don’t multiply matrices as usual; you multiply them component-wise. Every component is multiplied by itself, and then you take the trace or sum all elements.\nEach coordinate in this matrix is computed as:\nF_{\\mu\\nu} = \\partial_\\mu A_\\nu - \\partial_\\nu A_\\mu\nwhere \\partial_\\nu is the derivative in time and space — essentially \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\nu}."

    "section": "8 Gauge Transformations",
    "text": "8 Gauge Transformations\nGo to the next portion — the Rancho Kinemic picture.\nWhile I’m cleaning the board, let me ask questions about this point.\nWe discussed the Lagrangian and equations of motion. Let’s discuss gauge transformation and gauge symmetry — an extremely important concept in field theory.\nWe’ll only touch on this briefly since we’re not doing field theory, but it’s really important you know where legs grow from it.\nSomething very familiar from quantum mechanics is the phase ambiguity of the wave function. We can update the phase, and the absolute square of the wave function won’t change because you multiply \\psi to \\psi^* and the phase drops out.\nThis is fine. First is to acknowledge that this should be a symmetry of our theory — we should be allowed to make this phase transformation.\nIt’s kind of by definition, so this overall phase you don’t even have to think about.\nThe problem appears when you demand your theory to be invariant under changes of phase at all possible space-time points simultaneously with different phases.\nWhat if I want to adjust my wave function at every space point?\nWhy is this a problem? Because in our equation of motion, in our Lagrangian — let me just write the Dirac part: \\bar{\\psi}D_\\mu\\gamma^\\mu\\psi.\nHere I have a term \\partial_\\mu\\psi, and this term becomes \\partial_\\mu\\psi' which is \\partial_\\mu(e^{i\\alpha(x)}\\psi).\nLet me take the derivative. This equals applying the derivative to the first term and then to the second term.\nWhen I apply it to the second term, I just have \\partial_\\mu\\psi. When I apply it to the first term, I get \\partial_\\mu acting on this — the exponent stays, but I have to take the derivative of the exponent.\nSo there’s an extra term. Indeed, the same equation won’t hold for \\psi'. It doesn’t transform to the same equation because the derivative yields another term with \\partial_\\mu\\alpha.\nThis means that local gauge transformation is not a symmetry of the free Lagrangian of the free moving Dirac particle.\nYou cannot adjust phase independently at different points for a free particle.\nIn simple words, this means the theory is incomplete. It only becomes complete if you consider radiation, photons, and charged particles together.\nOnce you look at the full Lagrangian (I think I get a minus here — that’s an exercise in field theory), you update simultaneously the phase of the field \\psi and the electromagnetic field A.\nThen you see that the additional term appearing in the covariant derivative D_\\mu will cancel exactly the one you get from the phase.\nThen the Lagrangian stays the same with the updated fields \\psi and A.\nThis fact led us to the D_\\mu term. Actually, writing D_\\mu minus or plus — was it plus before or minus? That’s correct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe covariant derivative in QED is: D_\\mu = \\partial_\\mu - ieA_\\mu This ensures local U(1) gauge invariance by canceling the extra terms from phase transformations, with e being the electromagnetic coupling constant."

They have to interact with strength g.\nThe structure is very simple. Again, this is a scalar quantity.\nYou can figure out and convince yourself that the same integral is a scalar quantity.

    "section": "10 Extending to Other Theories",
    "text": "10 Extending to Other Theories\nNow we’ll take this idea and move from QED to QCD.\nBefore jumping to QCD, where we deal with wave functions in three dimensions, let’s consider wave functions in the space of two coordinates — the case for weak interaction.\nFor weak interaction, you have up components and down components. Remember how the weak charge for quarks was +1/2 or -1/2 — the same range.\nHere you have an up field and down field. Remember, it’s still a fermion, so they have hidden four spinor components (we don’t talk about that).\nIn that case, the transformation that updates the phase is more general.\nWhat we want is that the update happening here doesn’t change the observable. Our observable will be \\psi^\\dagger\\psi.\nG or the matrix that updates the field — \\psi is the 2 \\times 2 matrix, and it’s unitary because observables should not change.\nIn this case, we’re dealing with transformations that are unitary, described by unitary matrices spanning the class called the U(2) group.\nWe’ll also fix the determinant of this matrix to be 1, and then this S comes from — for all matrices with determinant equal to 1 and unitary, they can be represented as an exponent.\nWho has seen the exponent of a matrix before? If you saw, what is this? Can you tell me what I should write here and then V?\nThis is more complicated. As soon as I put here one, it gets a little bit…\nWe solved it last year, right? I think it’s either 1 or 1 - e something. So e to 1, 1, 10 gets more complicated.\n\n10.1 Matrix Exponentiation and Generators in SU(N) Groups\nExactly right. So the approach is to take the expansion and perform multiple matrix multiplications.\nI recall it’s either e^{1} or 1 - e, but here, this is certainly not zero — and in fact, I’m not entirely sure about that anyway — so you understand what I’m referring to.\nThis is matrix exponentiation, and you can represent any element of the SU(2) group using matrix exponentiation. Here, we have a 2 \\times 2 matrix with zero trace. That condition comes from the determinant: \n\\det(U) = e^{\\mathrm{Tr}(\\alpha)} = 1\n which implies the trace of \\alpha must be zero.\nIn fact, there are only three matrices that span the entire basis of such traceless matrices: the Pauli matrices. These are called the generators of the group because they generate any group element.\nOnce we identify these three generators, we can take any three real numbers \\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, compute the combination -i\\alpha_j \\sigma_j, exponentiate it, and obtain an element of SU(2) — and in fact, this spans the entire group. You need to know the generator matrices — they’re fixed — then provide three numbers, and I can plug them into a Python routine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny element of SU(2) can be written as: \nU = e^{-i \\alpha_j \\sigma_j}\n where \\sigma_j are the Pauli matrices and \\alpha_j are real parameters.\n\n\n\nIs there a reason we fix the determinant to 1? Yes — because we’re working with SU(2). In general, \nU(N) = U(1) \\times SU(N)\n So U(2) is U(1) × SU(2). The U(1) part is just a simple scalar phase, while SU(2) contains the non-trivial matrix structure. The scalar phase behaves exactly as in the 2D case, but the SU(2) matrix gives something interesting.\nSo I see the relationship, but why do we fix the determinant? Because SU(2) is one of the standard groups — we know a lot about it. If we considered U(2) instead, we’d have more generators and greater complexity. SU(2) is one of the primary elementary groups — that’s the main reason. We know everything about SU(2): how many generators it has, its matrix structure — it’s a nice object to work with.\nThis factorization helps us proceed similarly for higher groups: \nU(3) = U(1) \\times SU(3)\n We factor out the phase, and what remains is the standard group SU(3), which we use to describe the global update of the wave function with the same components. This is exactly what we deal with in quantum chromodynamics (QCD).\nWhen dealing with color charge, we don’t have two components — we have three: red, blue, and green. The transformation is then a 3 \\times 3 matrix with an overall phase — that’s not too complicated. We’ve discussed this before.\nBut then there’s a non-trivial contribution where you update your fields significantly. These are 3 \\times 3 matrices with determinant equal to 1. Again, you can relate this to the matrix exponential, and the exponent must be traceless.\nThe basis of traceless matrices in three dimensions that satisfy the anti-commutation properties — should I say the output must be anti-Hermitian? Does it hold for our condition? We insert it, multiply by two, and get -i\\alpha, then move to the other part.\nIf you look at the basis in two dimensions for traceless matrices, you get three generators; in three dimensions, you get eight. The number of generators is related to the number of charge carriers in the field.\nIn fact, we identify each generator matrix with the action of the field because they appear in the interaction term. The interaction term includes this matrix: every time you attach the field \\psi and the interaction field A, it comes together with this generator matrix.\nTo connect this back: remember where this chunk came from? We were computing derivatives and found an extra derivative for the phase. This extra derivative led us to introduce an extended derivative of the field — an interaction term that appears in Feynman diagrams.\nAs soon as we deal with higher dimensions, the same derivative we compute will come together with the appropriate matrix. So \\alpha is now 2 \\times 2, and it will appear here as another matrix. These generator matrices — \\sigma for SU(2), or \\lambda for SU(3) — will appear in the interaction vertex.\nWe find that:\n\nFor SU(2): 3 generators → 3 charge carriers: Z, W^+, W^-\nFor SU(3): 8 generators → 8 gluons\n\nUnfortunately, we lack the imagination to name all eight gluons properly, but they are identified by their matrices.\nIn the case of weak interaction, one matrix is diagonal in the space — roughly corresponding to the Z boson. The W and Z are charged similarly to the gluon field; some will be diagonal, and we identify certain extra hypercharges for the states. Some will behave like W_2, W^+, depending on the matrix.\nYou’ll see the same matrices in homework exercises. Think of them as the eight different gluons — you can name them, and they act differently on the field. They appear in the interaction vertex depending on the flavor of the gluon interacting with the quark. Each vertex behaves differently, driven by the structure of the Pauli matrices or their generalizations.\nThat’s why it’s a good exercise to think about this interaction term: How does this become a skewer? How do we contract the color charge? It’s a big, old puzzle.\nNow, the last part: I have two more topics. Confinement is important to discuss, so let me say a few words about it, and then we’ll go through the basic equations quickly.\nConfinement is the property of the theory where the strong interaction grows with distance. Unlike electromagnetic interactions, which decrease with distance, the strong interaction governing color charge increases when you pull quarks apart. This confines quarks to small scales.\nThe only way to feel the strong interaction is to zoom in to the smallest objects: mesons and baryons. Let’s draw them again:\n\nThis is a meson\nThis is a baryon\n\nThe word “confined” means that the strong interaction exists only inside the bubble of the meson or baryon. There is no strong interaction outside. If you try to pull them apart with huge force, at some point they divide — but then the resulting objects are again color-neutral, confined, and travel as stable particles.\nColor neutral means having zero charge with respect to the strong interaction. Remember: as soon as a particle has color charge, gluons can interact with it — meaning it’s not confined. Therefore, matter forms into these little bubbles where strong interactions are active inside, but outside they don’t feel the strong field — they are color neutral.\nI’m not deriving this — I’m stating it as a fact of the theory, proven by the existence of life as we know it. Confinement plays a vital role in binding and making life possible.\nHowever, if you look at the Lagrangian — where did our Lagrangian go? — you can’t directly see that it’s a confined theory. There are indications of confinement in the Lagrangian, and one of them is the gluon self-interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Diagrams of gluon self-interactions arising from the gauge part of the Lagrangian. These illustrate the non-Abelian nature of QCD and provide the basis for color confinement.\n\n\n\nIn QED, we had photon terms; in QCD, we have G_\\mu terms like: \nG_\\mu G_\\nu - G_\\nu G_\\mu + f^{abc} G_\\nu G_\\nu\n and then G_\\mu G_\\mu with 3-gluon and 4-gluon terms. These manifest in interaction vertices like this and this — called gluon self-interactions.\nGluon self-interaction is one indication of confinement — not a proof, but a clue. People study all possible field theories; some have confinement, some don’t. Confinement remains one of the great unsolved problems — there’s even a prize waiting for whoever can explain it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe running coupling \\alpha_s(Q) depends on the momentum transfer Q:\n\nAsymptotic freedom: \\alpha_s(Q) \\to 0 as Q \\to \\infty\nConfinement: \\alpha_s(Q) grows large at low Q (around 1 GeV)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Running of the strong coupling \\alpha_s(Q) with momentum transfer Q. At high Q, the coupling decreases, showing asymptotic freedom; at low Q \\lesssim 1 GeV, the coupling grows large, marking the confinement region.\n\n\n\nWe define Q as the momentum with which we probe the hadron. What we experience is the effective strong coupling \\alpha_s^{\\text{eff}}. You can think of a gluon coming in, interacting with a quark, and a lot happening — effectively, one quantum bubble with an effective interaction strength that depends on the gluon’s momentum.\nThis gluon, depending on its energy, will experience different interaction strengths. In electromagnetic interactions, we discuss screening effects; here, the effective interaction depends on Q as follows:\n\nIf Q is very high, we’re in the regime of asymptotic freedom\nIf Q is low, we’re in the regime of confinement\n\nThe transition happens around 1 GeV. Hadrons live in the low-Q region.\nIf you think about it: these particles talk to each other, exchange gluons, and the gluon couples to the fermion. When they’re close together, the gluon momentum is small — below 1 GeV — and that’s where the interaction is super strong. Meanwhile, at very high momentum transfer, the coupling becomes small — that’s asymptotic freedom, which we’ll discuss more later.\n\n\n10.2 Nuclear Binding and Decay Fundamentals\nI notice you’ve provided detailed instructions and examples for editing lecture transcripts, but you haven’t included the actual nuclear physics lecture transcription that needs to be polished.\nThe helping material contains several relevant nuclear physics formulas that could be integrated if they appear in your transcript:\nKey Nuclear Physics Formulas:\n\nNuclear Binding Energy: Calculates the energy equivalent of the mass defect: B(Z,A) = [Zm_p + (A-Z)m_n - m_{\\text{nucleus}}]c^2\nSemi-Empirical Mass Formula: Approximates binding energy based on the liquid drop model: B(Z,A) = a_V A - a_S A^{2/3} - a_C \\frac{Z(Z-1)}{A^{1/3}} - a_A \\frac{(A-2Z)^2}{A} + \\delta(A,Z)\nRadioactive Decay Law: Follows exponential decay: N(t) = N_0e^{-\\lambda t}\nRutherford Scattering: Describes angular distribution: \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\left(\\frac{Z_1Z_2e^2}{8\\pi\\epsilon_0E}\\right)^2 \\frac{1}{\\sin^4(\\theta/2)}\nUniverse Evolution Timeline: Includes key phases:\nt \\sim 10^{-12} seconds: Quark-Gluon Plasma\nt \\sim 1 second: Big Bang nucleosynthesis begins\nQuark Charge Properties:\nUp-type quarks (u, c, t): Electric charge +\\frac{2}{3}\nDown-type quarks (d, s, b): Electric charge -\\frac{1}{3}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese formulas represent fundamental concepts in nuclear and particle physics that might appear in your lecture transcript.

The only difference is the actual particle type, yet the tracks appear identical.\nWithout proper particle identification, we face two critical issues:\n\nMomentum is measured correctly from track curvature\nEnergy calculation is wrong due to incorrect mass assumption\nInvariant mass reconstruction becomes incorrect using:\n\nM^2 = \\left(\\sum E_i\\right)^2 - \\left(\\sum \\vec{p}_i\\right)^2c^2\nThe invariant mass should correspond to the B meson mass with correct particle identification, but we observe something completely different.

    "text": "4 Practical Demonstration and Solutions\nThis makes an excellent homework problem: take an event, compute the kaon’s momentum assuming it’s a pion, then recalculate the invariant mass. You’ll obtain a different value because:\nM_{\\text{wrong}}^2 = \\left(E_{\\text{wrong}} + \\sum E_{\\text{others}}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\vec{p}_{\\text{measured}} + \\sum \\vec{p}_{\\text{others}}\\right)^2c^2\nThe mass shift occurs specifically because the kaon mass is larger than the pion mass. Using a smaller mass assumption instead of the correct larger mass causes this displacement through incorrect energy computation.\nWithout particle identification information, our analyses would be fundamentally compromised. This is precisely why we need specialized particle identification detectors like:\n\nRing imaging Cherenkov detectors\nTime-of-flight systems\n\nThese systems are essential in modern particle physics experiments to suppress misidentifications and ensure accurate particle reconstruction.\n\n4.1 Phase Space Factorization in Particle Collisions\nWhen we conduct experiments, it’s always important to simulate and observe expected outcomes by modeling different reactions. For this purpose, we use computer programs that replicate the experimental setup, simulating particle collisions, all possible decays and processes, and tracking particle movement through a detector.\nIt’s essential to know the cross section of different processes, but equally important is understanding the available configuration space for various particles. This is governed by the phase space—the space of all possible kinematic configurations.\nFor N particles, the phase space is described by the following Lorentz-invariant differential:\n\nd\\Phi_N = \\left[\\prod_{i=1}^N \\frac{d^3\\mathbf{p}_i}{(2\\pi)^3 2E_i}\\right] (2\\pi)^4 \\delta^{(4)}\\left(P - \\sum_{i=1}^N p_i\\right)\n\nThis expression contains 3N - 4 integrals, reflecting the constraints from:\n\nFour-momentum conservation (via the delta function)\nOn-shell mass conditions for each particle\n\nThe two-body phase space has a more direct form:\n\nd\\Phi_2 = \\frac{1}{8\\pi} \\frac{2|\\mathbf{p}|}{\\sqrt{s}} \\frac{d\\Omega}{4\\pi}\n\nThis results from resolving the energy-momentum conservation delta functions. For two particles:\n\nYou start with eight integrals\nSubtract two from mass constraints (one per particle)\nSubtract four from energy-momentum conservation\nThe remaining two differentials correspond to angular integration\n\nIn the center-of-mass frame, the particles are back-to-back, so the only freedom is their direction, parameterized by the solid angle d\\Omega = d\\cos\\theta d\\phi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prefactor 1/(8\\pi) and the relativistic term 2|\\mathbf{p}|/\\sqrt{s} account for phase space volume and relativistic kinematics, while the angular factor d\\Omega/(4\\pi) covers orientation in space. The three-body phase space is more complex and interesting:\n\n\n\n\nd\\Phi_3(1,2,3)\n\nThis Lorentz-invariant expression can be evaluated in any reference frame. A powerful approach is to factorize it using two-body topologies:\n\nd\\Phi_3 = d\\Phi_2(P \\to 12,3) \\times d\\Phi_2(p_{12} \\to 1,2) \\times dm_{12}^2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: 2 A sketch illustrating the recursive relation when computing the phase-space expression. This is not a dynamic assumption but a mathematical trick that rewrites the full three-body phase-space through lower-dimensional phase-space elements and the two-body phase-space, for which the expression is simple.\n\n\n\nInterpretation:\n\nFirst, treat particles 1 and 2 as a composite system with invariant mass m_{12}\nFactor into a two-body decay P \\to (12) + 3\nThen decay the composite (12) into particles 1 and 2\nIntegrate over all possible invariant masses m_{12}\n\nThis factorization works because introducing the invariant mass variable and corresponding delta functions preserves the kinematic degrees of freedom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: 5 A dynamic diagram of a cascade decay, where particle 0 decays to a three-body final state through an intermediate state x that sequentially decays into particles 1 and 2. The intermediate particle carries spin j and serves as an expansion term of the full amplitude, known as the partial projection term. Lines represent initial and final state particles, while the double line denotes the intermediate particle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: 1 A unitary diagram for the three-body decay. The arrows show the initial and final state particles, and the blob stands for the interaction that transforms the initial state into the final state.\n\n\n\nRefer to Figure 3\nThis recursive approach generalizes to N-body phase space, allowing complex multiparticle phase spaces to be built systematically from simpler two-body components—a valuable technique for both analytical calculations and numerical simulations.\n\n\n4.2 Three-Body Decay Phase Space and the Dalitz Plot\nGood morning, everyone.\nWe spent 10 minutes thinking about the Dalitz plot, and next time we will try a few more steps to get our nice picture.\nThe expression T_{53} is equal to…\nNow I’m going to replace these with their expressions: \\frac{1}{8\\pi^2 p}.\nThat’s the whole expression where we just replaced two-body phase spaces by their corresponding expressions.\nThe number of integrals remained unchanged.\nWe have done nothing non-trivial so far — we just resolved all of the delta functions.\nThe first term has a nice expression in the rest frame of the pair, specifically the rest frame of particles 1, 2, and 3.\nHere we have P_{123}, which is the momentum of particle 1, 2, or 3 in the 1–3 rest frame.\nAnd here we have K, which is the momentum of particle 1 or 2 in the corresponding rest frame.\nThe last step that remained is to express the cosine — this is the orientation of the frame.\nRefer to Figure 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: 7 A kinematic configuration for the introduction of the helicity matrix in the transition of particle x decaying into particles 1 and 2. The representation is drawn in the rest frame of particle x, shown as a dot at rest, with arrows representing the three-momenta of particles 1 and 2 in this frame.\n\n\n\nI would like to compute M_{23}^2 = (p_2 + p_3)^2.\nThis becomes: \nM_{23}^2 = m_2^2 + m_3^2 + 2E_2E_3 - 2|\\vec{p}_2||\\vec{p}_3|\\cos\\theta_{23}\n\nWhat we are going to do is replace d(\\cos\\theta_{12}) with dM_{12}^2.\nThis function stands for the masses.\nI’m going to the arguments of the lambda function: \\lambda^{1/2}(m_{\\pi\\pi}, m_{12}^2, m_1^2, m_2^2) and then \\lambda^{3/2}(m_0^2, s, m_3^2).\nFor convenience, I mean \\lambda^{1/2}(m_{12}^2, s, m_3^2).\nThe point is that M_{23} is the variable when I did the splitting somewhere here.\nThese two particles in this splitting do not know each other.\nHowever, the scattering angle in the 1–2 rest frame determines linearly the mass of the third particle in this system.\nWhat I can do is trade the scattering angle.\nHere is particle 1, here is particle 2, here is particle 3, and here is particle 0 in the 1–2 rest frame.\nI’m trading this angle \\cos\\theta_{12} into combinations of particles 2 and 3.\nI express the mass of particles 2 and 3 as a function of the cosine, and I find linear dependence: \nM_{23}^2 = m_2^2 + m_3^2 + 2E_2E_3 - 2|\\vec{p}_2||\\vec{p}_3|\\cos\\theta_{23}\n\nThis enables me to replace the integration here by the mass.\nWhat I’m going to obtain then is that the phase space simply equals all of the angle integrations that are just in the cubic domain times mass integrations over s.\nHere, s is the fixed number for the decay — it’s determined by the total mass of the system.\nThe phase space is flat in two variables: the two masses of the pairs.\nFlat means there is no dependence — this expression does not depend on M_1 and M_2.\nAs you remember, the cross section or the width differential is: \nd\\Gamma = \\frac{1}{2M_0\\sqrt{s}} |\\mathcal{M}|^2 \\, d\\Phi\n\nSo the phase space density is replaced with this expression.\nThe entire phase space is sitting in the integrals of this area.\nEvery configuration of the momenta can be mapped into a point inside the phase space — that corresponds to a point here.\nThis surface is described by the condition \\Phi(s_{12}, s_{23}) &lt; 0.\nThat’s what I mean.\nThe interior of the phase space domain is described by a beautiful function \\lambda of three lambdas, which is called the Kibble function.\nThe Kibble function has to be smaller than zero.\nYou compute the Kibble function by computing \\lambda_i, which is \\lambda(s, m_i^2, m_j^2).\nEssentially, \\lambda_1 is computed as \\lambda(s, m_1^2, m_{23}^2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kibble function defines the physical boundary of the Dalitz plot: \n\\Phi(s_{12}, s_{23}) = \\lambda(s_{12}, s_{23}, s_{13}) &lt; 0\n where \n\\lambda(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2xy - 2xz - 2yz\n When \\Phi &lt; 0, the point (s_{12}, s_{23}) corresponds to a physically allowed configuration.\n\n\n\nThe point is: for three-body decays, any configuration of the momenta can be mapped into a point of the Dalitz plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: 3 The Dalitz plot, a representation of the phase-space for the three-body decay. It appears as an ellipse-shaped area where the internal region corresponds to allowed kinematics and the outside region is forbidden. On the x-axis lies the squared mass of two final-state particles, while the y-axis corresponds to the other subsystem. A horizontal line represents a slice of the phase-space with one mass fixed. The borders of the area correspond to configurations where all three momenta are aligned in the rest frame of the decaying particle, or equivalently, where the scattering angle in the relevant rest frame is either 0 or π.\n\n\n\nThis is the Dalitz plot.\nRefer to Figure 7\nIt’s a very nice way to visualize:\n\nHow the matrix element proceeds\nHow decay proceeds\nHow the matrix element looks like\n\nBecause there is no additional curvature to this density due to the phase space, all configurations that are here are equally allowed from the phase space perspective.\nOnly suppression comes due to the matrix element |\\mathcal{M}|^2.\n\n\n4.3 Mapping Momenta to Dalitz Plot Coordinates\nSo let me show you quickly one fun exercise that was given at the school last year.\nYou get a configuration of three momenta: \\vec{p}_1, \\vec{p}_2, and \\vec{p}_3, with the constraint that they add up to zero:\n\\vec{p}_1 + \\vec{p}_2 + \\vec{p}_3 = \\vec{0}\nThe task is to map this momentum configuration into a point in the Dalitz plot.\nRefer to Figure 5\nRefer to Figure 2\nRefer to Figure 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Kinematic Formulas for Dalitz Plot Analysis:\n\nInvariant mass squared: s_{ij} = (p_i + p_j)^2 = m_i^2 + m_j^2 + 2E_iE_j - 2\\vec{p}_i \\cdot \\vec{p}_j\nBoundary constraint: s_{12} + s_{23} + s_{31} = m_1^2 + m_2^2 + m_3^2 + M^2\nKinematic limits: (m_i + m_j)^2 \\leq s_{ij} \\leq (M - m_k)^2\nPhase space element: d\\Phi_3 = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^5} \\frac{1}{16M^2} ds_{12} ds_{23}\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s address the fundamental questions about this exercise:\n\nWhat is the phase space? The phase space represents all possible momentum configurations satisfying conservation laws, described mathematically by the phase space element above. Refer to Figure 7\nWhat are the particle masses? For this specific problem, are all particles pions? We need to know the masses m_1, m_2, m_3 and the initial particle mass M to define the Dalitz plot boundaries.\n\nI also have for you an example of a Dalitz plot from the COMPASS measurement. Refer to Figure 7\nThe second, unrelated problem is to compute how the mass distribution looks when you have a two-dimensional distribution, where mass is given in the brackets."
