    "text": "1 Particle Tracking and Momentum Measurement\nWhen we track charged particles, we don’t measure their mass directly. Instead, we determine momentum from the curvature of the particle’s track in a magnetic field using the fundamental relationship:\np = qBR\nThis formula comes from balancing the Lorentz force with centripetal force for charged particles moving in uniform magnetic fields. By solving the differential equations for charged particle trajectories, we can adjust the momentum to fit the measured tracking points and thus determine the particle’s momentum accurately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe momentum formula p = qBR relates a charged particle’s momentum to the magnetic field strength B and trajectory radius R, where q is the particle’s charge."

    "text": "2 Energy Computation and Mass Assumptions\nThe four-vector has energy and momentum components. While we measure momentum directly, we must compute energy under specific mass assumptions using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:\nE^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4\nIn practice, we must assume the particle type (e.g., assuming it’s a pion) to perform these energy calculations. The thousands of charged particles we observe all appear similar in tracking detectors - without additional identification information, we cannot distinguish whether they are pions, protons, kaons, or other particles.\nThe critical problem arises when we lack particle identification detectors and must rely on assumptions, which often create significant backgrounds in our analyses."

The only difference is the actual particle type, yet the tracks appear identical.\nWithout proper particle identification, we face two critical issues:\n\nMomentum is measured correctly from track curvature\nEnergy calculation is wrong due to incorrect mass assumption\nInvariant mass reconstruction becomes incorrect using:\n\nM^2 = \\left(\\sum E_i\\right)^2 - \\left(\\sum \\vec{p}_i\\right)^2c^2\nThe invariant mass should correspond to the B meson mass with correct particle identification, but we observe something completely different. The reflection of this reaction appears displaced in the mass spectrum."

    "text": "4 Practical Demonstration and Solutions\nThis makes an excellent homework problem: take an event, compute the kaon’s momentum assuming it’s a pion, then recalculate the invariant mass. You’ll obtain a different value because:\nM_{\\text{wrong}}^2 = \\left(E_{\\text{wrong}} + \\sum E_{\\text{others}}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\vec{p}_{\\text{measured}} + \\sum \\vec{p}_{\\text{others}}\\right)^2c^2\nThe mass shift occurs specifically because the kaon mass is larger than the pion mass. Using a smaller mass assumption instead of the correct larger mass causes this displacement through incorrect energy computation.\nWithout particle identification information, our analyses would be fundamentally compromised. This is precisely why we need specialized particle identification detectors like:\n\nRing imaging Cherenkov detectors\nTime-of-flight systems\n\nThese systems are essential in modern particle physics experiments to suppress misidentifications and ensure accurate particle reconstruction.\n\n4.1 Phase Space Factorization in Particle Collisions\nWhen we conduct experiments, it’s always important to simulate and observe expected outcomes by modeling different reactions. For this purpose, we use computer programs that replicate the experimental setup, simulating particle collisions, all possible decays and processes, and tracking particle movement through a detector.\nIt’s essential to know the cross section of different processes, but equally important is understanding the available configuration space for various particles. This is governed by the phase space—the space of all possible kinematic configurations.\nFor N particles, the phase space is described by the following Lorentz-invariant differential:\n\nd\\Phi_N = \\left[\\prod_{i=1}^N \\frac{d^3\\mathbf{p}_i}{(2\\pi)^3 2E_i}\\right] (2\\pi)^4 \\delta^{(4)}\\left(P - \\sum_{i=1}^N p_i\\right)\n\nThis expression contains 3N - 4 integrals, reflecting the constraints from:\n\nFour-momentum conservation (via the delta function)\nOn-shell mass conditions for each particle\n\nThe two-body phase space has a more direct form:\n\nd\\Phi_2 = \\frac{1}{8\\pi} \\frac{2|\\mathbf{p}|}{\\sqrt{s}} \\frac{d\\Omega}{4\\pi}\n\nThis results from resolving the energy-momentum conservation delta functions. For two particles:\n\nYou start with eight integrals\nSubtract two from mass constraints (one per particle)\nSubtract four from energy-momentum conservation\nThe remaining two differentials correspond to angular integration\n\nIn the center-of-mass frame, the particles are back-to-back, so the only freedom is their direction, parameterized by the solid angle d\\Omega = d\\cos\\theta d\\phi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prefactor 1/(8\\pi) and the relativistic term 2|\\mathbf{p}|/\\sqrt{s} account for phase space volume and relativistic kinematics, while the angular factor d\\Omega/(4\\pi) covers orientation in space. The three-body phase space is more complex and interesting:\n\n\n\n\nd\\Phi_3(1,2,3)\n\nThis Lorentz-invariant expression can be evaluated in any reference frame. A powerful approach is to factorize it using two-body topologies:\n\nd\\Phi_3 = d\\Phi_2(P \\to 12,3) \\times d\\Phi_2(p_{12} \\to 1,2) \\times dm_{12}^2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: 2 A sketch illustrating the recursive relation when computing the phase-space expression. This is not a dynamic assumption but a mathematical trick that rewrites the full three-body phase-space through lower-dimensional phase-space elements and the two-body phase-space, for which the expression is simple.\n\n\n\nInterpretation:\n\nFirst, treat particles 1 and 2 as a composite system with invariant mass m_{12}\nFactor into a two-body decay P \\to (12) + 3\nThen decay the composite (12) into particles 1 and 2\nIntegrate over all possible invariant masses m_{12}\n\nThis factorization works because introducing the invariant mass variable and corresponding delta functions preserves the kinematic degrees of freedom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: 5 A dynamic diagram of a cascade decay, where particle 0 decays to a three-body final state through an intermediate state x that sequentially decays into particles 1 and 2. The intermediate particle carries spin j and serves as an expansion term of the full amplitude, known as the partial projection term. Lines represent initial and final state particles, while the double line denotes the intermediate particle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: 1 A unitary diagram for the three-body decay. The arrows show the initial and final state particles, and the blob stands for the interaction that transforms the initial state into the final state.\n\n\n\nRefer to Figure 3\nThis recursive approach generalizes to N-body phase space, allowing complex multiparticle phase spaces to be built systematically from simpler two-body components—a valuable technique for both analytical calculations and numerical simulations.\n\n\n4.2 Three-Body Decay Phase Space and the Dalitz Plot\nGood morning, everyone.\nWe spent 10 minutes thinking about the Dalitz plot, and next time we will try a few more steps to get our nice picture.\nThe expression T_{53} is equal to…\nNow I’m going to replace these with their expressions: \\frac{1}{8\\pi^2 p}.\nThat’s the whole expression where we just replaced two-body phase spaces by their corresponding expressions.\nThe number of integrals remained unchanged.\nWe have done nothing non-trivial so far — we just resolved all of the delta functions.\nThe first term has a nice expression in the rest frame of the pair, specifically the rest frame of particles 1, 2, and 3.\nHere we have P_{123}, which is the momentum of particle 1, 2, or 3 in the 1–3 rest frame.\nAnd here we have K, which is the momentum of particle 1 or 2 in the corresponding rest frame.\nThe last step that remained is to express the cosine — this is the orientation of the frame.\nRefer to Figure 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: 7 A kinematic configuration for the introduction of the helicity matrix in the transition of particle x decaying into particles 1 and 2. The representation is drawn in the rest frame of particle x, shown as a dot at rest, with arrows representing the three-momenta of particles 1 and 2 in this frame.\n\n\n\nI would like to compute M_{23}^2 = (p_2 + p_3)^2.\nThis becomes: \nM_{23}^2 = m_2^2 + m_3^2 + 2E_2E_3 - 2|\\vec{p}_2||\\vec{p}_3|\\cos\\theta_{23}\n\nWhat we are going to do is replace d(\\cos\\theta_{12}) with dM_{12}^2.\nThis function stands for the masses.\nI’m going to the arguments of the lambda function: \\lambda^{1/2}(m_{\\pi\\pi}, m_{12}^2, m_1^2, m_2^2) and then \\lambda^{3/2}(m_0^2, s, m_3^2).\nFor convenience, I mean \\lambda^{1/2}(m_{12}^2, s, m_3^2).\nThe point is that M_{23} is the variable when I did the splitting somewhere here.\nThese two particles in this splitting do not know each other.\nHowever, the scattering angle in the 1–2 rest frame determines linearly the mass of the third particle in this system.\nWhat I can do is trade the scattering angle.\nHere is particle 1, here is particle 2, here is particle 3, and here is particle 0 in the 1–2 rest frame.\nI’m trading this angle \\cos\\theta_{12} into combinations of particles 2 and 3.\nI express the mass of particles 2 and 3 as a function of the cosine, and I find linear dependence: \nM_{23}^2 = m_2^2 + m_3^2 + 2E_2E_3 - 2|\\vec{p}_2||\\vec{p}_3|\\cos\\theta_{23}\n\nThis enables me to replace the integration here by the mass.\nWhat I’m going to obtain then is that the phase space simply equals all of the angle integrations that are just in the cubic domain times mass integrations over s.\nHere, s is the fixed number for the decay — it’s determined by the total mass of the system.\nThe phase space is flat in two variables: the two masses of the pairs.\nFlat means there is no dependence — this expression does not depend on M_1 and M_2.\nAs you remember, the cross section or the width differential is: \nd\\Gamma = \\frac{1}{2M_0\\sqrt{s}} |\\mathcal{M}|^2 \\, d\\Phi\n\nSo the phase space density is replaced with this expression.\nThe entire phase space is sitting in the integrals of this area.\nEvery configuration of the momenta can be mapped into a point inside the phase space — that corresponds to a point here.\nThis surface is described by the condition \\Phi(s_{12}, s_{23}) &lt; 0.\nThat’s what I mean.\nThe interior of the phase space domain is described by a beautiful function \\lambda of three lambdas, which is called the Kibble function.\nThe Kibble function has to be smaller than zero.\nYou compute the Kibble function by computing \\lambda_i, which is \\lambda(s, m_i^2, m_j^2).\nEssentially, \\lambda_1 is computed as \\lambda(s, m_1^2, m_{23}^2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Kibble function defines the physical boundary of the Dalitz plot: \n\\Phi(s_{12}, s_{23}) = \\lambda(s_{12}, s_{23}, s_{13}) &lt; 0\n where \n\\lambda(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2xy - 2xz - 2yz\n When \\Phi &lt; 0, the point (s_{12}, s_{23}) corresponds to a physically allowed configuration.\n\n\n\nThe point is: for three-body decays, any configuration of the momenta can be mapped into a point of the Dalitz plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: 3 The Dalitz plot, a representation of the phase-space for the three-body decay. It appears as an ellipse-shaped area where the internal region corresponds to allowed kinematics and the outside region is forbidden. On the x-axis lies the squared mass of two final-state particles, while the y-axis corresponds to the other subsystem. A horizontal line represents a slice of the phase-space with one mass fixed. The borders of the area correspond to configurations where all three momenta are aligned in the rest frame of the decaying particle, or equivalently, where the scattering angle in the relevant rest frame is either 0 or π.\n\n\n\nThis is the Dalitz plot.\nRefer to Figure 7\nIt’s a very nice way to visualize:\n\nHow the matrix element proceeds\nHow decay proceeds\nHow the matrix element looks like\n\nBecause there is no additional curvature to this density due to the phase space, all configurations that are here are equally allowed from the phase space perspective.\nOnly suppression comes due to the matrix element |\\mathcal{M}|^2.\n\n\n4.3 Mapping Momenta to Dalitz Plot Coordinates\nSo let me show you quickly one fun exercise that was given at the school last year.\nYou get a configuration of three momenta: \\vec{p}_1, \\vec{p}_2, and \\vec{p}_3, with the constraint that they add up to zero:\n\\vec{p}_1 + \\vec{p}_2 + \\vec{p}_3 = \\vec{0}\nThe task is to map this momentum configuration into a point in the Dalitz plot.\nRefer to Figure 5\nRefer to Figure 2\nRefer to Figure 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Kinematic Formulas for Dalitz Plot Analysis:\n\nInvariant mass squared: s_{ij} = (p_i + p_j)^2 = m_i^2 + m_j^2 + 2E_iE_j - 2\\vec{p}_i \\cdot \\vec{p}_j\nBoundary constraint: s_{12} + s_{23} + s_{31} = m_1^2 + m_2^2 + m_3^2 + M^2\nKinematic limits: (m_i + m_j)^2 \\leq s_{ij} \\leq (M - m_k)^2\nPhase space element: d\\Phi_3 = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^5} \\frac{1}{16M^2} ds_{12} ds_{23}\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s address the fundamental questions about this exercise:\n\nWhat is the phase space? The phase space represents all possible momentum configurations satisfying conservation laws, described mathematically by the phase space element above. Refer to Figure 7\nWhat are the particle masses? For this specific problem, are all particles pions? We need to know the masses m_1, m_2, m_3 and the initial particle mass M to define the Dalitz plot boundaries.\n\nI also have for you an example of a Dalitz plot from the COMPASS measurement. Refer to Figure 7\nThe second, unrelated problem is to compute how the mass distribution looks when you have a two-dimensional distribution, where mass is given in the brackets."
