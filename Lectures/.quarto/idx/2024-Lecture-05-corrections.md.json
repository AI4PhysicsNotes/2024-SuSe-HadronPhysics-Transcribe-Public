Conservation of four-momentum imposes four constraints, reducing this to four degrees of freedom. Due to Lorentz invariance, the cross section is independent of the reference frame. By fixing the center-of-mass frame and aligning the collision axis, three rotational degrees of freedom are removed, leaving one independent variable (the scattering angle). However, for Lorentz-invariant amplitudes, the kinematics are fully described by two Mandelstam variables (e.g., $s$ and $t$), corresponding to two independent parameters. Thus, for part (a), there are **two** degrees of freedom.\n\n### Comment:\nThe original text contained multiple physics errors:  \n\n- Incorrect subtraction of \"six degrees\" for boosts and rotations (boosts do not reduce degrees of freedom in this context; only rotations are relevant).  \n- Misrepresentation of conservation law constraints (four-momentum conservation removes four degrees, not \"subtract four\" from an incorrect base).  \n- Ambiguous phrases (\"two times two, or four... multiply by three... subtract four\") were removed for clarity.  \nThe corrected version maintains the valid conclusion (two degrees of freedom) but derives it through proper relativistic kinematics, Mandelstam variables, and Lorentz invariance.

Why four? The angle between the two production particles and the angle between the 3-minus and 1-plus particles.\nHow would these angles be different? Why can't I introduce these angles in (a)?

Okay, let me update my notation later on.\nFor now, let me stick to the notations that relate to kinematics.\n\nIt's important to realize that the **phase space** for three-body decay is **flat** in the variables—it's actually constant in the variables $p_3, p_4, p_2, p_4$.\nIn $S$ and $T$, we write it as $\\frac{dN}{dX}$.\n\n### Score: 65\n\n### Correction:\nWe discussed **two-body kinematics**.  \nWe're going to continue discussing the **angular dependence** after the **Dalitz plot**.  \nSo the homework we had the exercise on the **Dalitz plot**, part of the course specific to hadrons. From this lecture onward, we will focus on **hadron spectroscopy**, including **three-body decay**. The **Dalitz plot** is a technique to study the dynamics of interactions.  \n\nIn **three-body decay**, one particle decays into three, with two variables fully describing the kinematics.

Preferences might happen.\n\nThis happens because particles have spin. This preference appears only because the intermediate resonance, in that case the K, is not a scalar particle—it has spin. The spin of particles causes the inhomogeneity in angular distributions and causes inhomogeneity in the decay spectrum.\n\n### Score: 85\n\n### Correction:\nOne thing to finish to move past this topic and proceed to our discussion is the angular distribution in resonance decays.

Even within a resonance band, decay probabilities may vary with angle—particles may preferentially align parallel or perpendicular to quantization axes. This anisotropy arises when the intermediate resonance has non-zero spin. The spin of the resonance induces directional preferences in the decay, resulting in non-uniform angular distributions.\n\n### Comment:\nThe physics content is largely correct but required refinement in terminology and precision:\n\n- Replaced \"inhomogeneity\" with \"anisotropy\" (standard term for angular dependence).\n- Clarified that spin-induced anisotropy occurs specifically for resonances with spin ≥1 (spin-0 particles yield isotropic distributions).\n- Removed vague phrasing (\"less probable kinematics,\" \"easy to believe\").\n- Specified that angular variation occurs at fixed invariant mass.\n- Retained correct core concepts: resonance rest frame kinematics, phase-space exploration via angle variation, and spin as the origin of anisotropy.\n\n\n# Index: 2\n\n### Original:\nAngular distribution is a very powerful tool to understand properties of particles.

Once you act with the rotation, most of the time you're going to end up with a mixture of all states. Let me rotate. These coefficients are tabulated, so they are known functions for any state. You can have a look and check what these coefficients are. They are called Wigner D-functions.\n\n::: callout-note\nThe Wigner D-functions describe rotations of spin states:\n$$ D^J_{M'M}(\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma) = e^{-iM'\\alpha}d^J_{M'M}(\\beta)e^{-iM\\gamma} $$\nwhere $(\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma)$ are Euler angles and $d^J_{M'M}$ is the reduced rotation matrix.\n:::\nLet me be more concrete. I'm going to rotate about the Y-axis in a second. So I have a Z, I have my X, and I have my Y. XYZ. That's correct. They should form the right-handed triple of axes X, Y, Z. I'm going to rotate about the Y-axis on $|JM\\rangle$. In order to do that, I have to—so $J_+$, as you remember, it's $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. So it operates like that. And $J_-$ is the opposite $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ like that. The $J_y$ operator then has zero on the diagonal and these coefficients above and below the diagonal.\n\nThen, in order to apply the transformation to the state, you have to do the matrix exponential of $J_y$. But this is done for you, and we know what they are. These are these coefficients, these coefficients where they are C, C, C, C. These coefficients—they need to know about the initial state as well. That's why JM indices are kept in these notations. Imagine I tell you we work with spin-1 that is perpendicular to the Y-axis and rotated by 30 degrees. What is going to be the composition of the state? When I do that, you have everything $|JM\\rangle$ that corresponds to this perpendicular—I mean, to the orientation along the Y-axis. Then you look up these functions, and you know what the composition is.\n\nWell, we have the same functions. These are coefficients so far, right? So these are numbers. But what is R in this case? Is it just θ? Okay, it's more general. You can compute the D-functions for any R. Essentially, the more general relation would be like this: any orientation in space can be described by three angles. These are Euler angles. In the conventions we use in particle physics, you first rotate by φ about the Z-axis, then you rotate by θ about the Y-axis, and then you rotate by γ again about the Z-axis. With this, you can give any orientation to your system.\n\nThese regular D-functions are the product of three parts. The most difficult part is the θ rotation. Since the Z-rotation gives you just a phase. Essentially, just to relate it to $\\langle M'|M\\rangle$ of γ, θ, φ is equal to $e^{-i γ M'} d^l_{M'M}(θ) e^{-i φ M}$.\n\n### Score: 85\n\n### Correction:\nA particle with spin can have $2J + 1$ projections to the quantization axis. Let me consider a particle that has spin $J$. There is a z-axis that we quantize the spin along, and this z-axis defines the $J_z$ component. One can think of the $|JM\\rangle$ state as a vector with $2J + 1$ components. All operators in this case are matrices that act on these vectors and produce either the same state with a certain eigenvalue or a superposition of states.\n\nWhen I rotate the state, I produce a superposition of different $M$ states. If the state were a classical vector, I could align it exactly, but in quantum mechanics, rotations generally create mixtures. The coefficients for these superpositions are tabulated as known functions called Wigner D-functions.\n\n::: callout-note\nThe Wigner D-functions describe rotations of spin states:\n$$ D^J_{M'M}(\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma) = e^{-iM'\\alpha}d^J_{M'M}(\\beta)e^{-iM\\gamma} $$\nwhere $(\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma)$ are Euler angles and $d^J_{M'M}$ is the reduced rotation matrix.\n:::\nTo be concrete, consider rotating $|JM\\rangle$ about the Y-axis. The $J_y$ operator has off-diagonal matrix elements. The rotation operator is given by the matrix exponential of $J_y$, but the result is encapsulated in the Wigner functions. These coefficients depend on the initial and final states, which is why the $J$, $M$, and $M'$ indices are retained. For example, for a spin-1 state initially quantized along the Y-axis and rotated by 30°, the composition is found using these functions.\n\nThe D-functions are defined for arbitrary rotations parameterized by Euler angles. In particle physics conventions, a general rotation $R$ consists of:  \n\n1. Rotation by $\\phi$ about the Z-axis,  \n2. Rotation by $\\theta$ about the Y-axis,  \n3. Rotation by $\\gamma$ about the (new) Z-axis.  \n\nThe matrix element is:  \n$$\\langle J, M' | R(\\phi, \\theta, \\gamma) | J, M \\rangle = e^{-i\\gamma M'} d^J_{M'M}(\\theta) e^{-i\\phi M}.$$  \nThe $\\theta$-dependent term $d^J_{M'M}(\\theta)$ is the core nontrivial component, as rotations about Z-axes only contribute phases.\n\n### Comment:\n\n- Removed inconsistent 2×2 matrix examples for $J_±$ (specific to spin-1/2) since the context is general spin $J$.\n- Corrected $d^l_{M'M} \\to d^J_{M'M}$ to match standard notation.\n- Clarified the Euler angle decomposition and the matrix element expression, explicitly including $J$ in states.\n- Removed redundant phrasing and minor grammatical issues for coherence.\n- Physics is now consistent: rotations mix $M$ states via Wigner D-functions, operators are $(2J+1)$-dimensional matrices, and the final formula uses standard conventions.\n\n\n# Index: 2\n\n### Original:\nThink we need an example—a very small one—of spin one-half.

These coefficients are sitting in the same place—where sitting in the same page as the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. They are closely related. This is about the SU(2) group, and you just open the Clebsch-Gordan table and check the numbers.\n\nSince 30 degrees is not at all trivial to do it, but now we won't have time to look at details, and hopefully in the seminar we will explore a little bit more. But I just remember this table because it's super simple. So the D for $m' = m = +1/2$ is the cosine minus sine, sine cosine of the half angle. I should have picked 60 degrees because for 15 degrees it's a little bit inconvenient. Then what is going to be here is the cosine of 15 degrees.

But how they decay and what is the asymmetry in the kinematics—this is determined by the quantum group. That's amazing.

The Dalitz plot kinematics formula is correct:  \n$$m_{12}^2 + m_{23}^2 + m_{31}^2 = m_D^2 + m_1^2 + m_2^2 + m_3^2$$  \nwhere $m_{ij}$ denotes the invariant mass of two decay products, $m_D$ is the decaying D-meson mass, and $m_1, m_2, m_3$ are the final-state particle masses. Notation is consistent (lowercase for masses), and the experimental context (CLEO/BaBar, D vs. $D_s$ decays) is appropriate. No physics errors or ambiguous statements require correction.\n\n\n# Index: 5\n\n### Original:\nThe exercise is to **figure out what decay this is**.\nThe axis labels are still there, but you just do not know what the mass is.\nFrom the **kinematics**, you can figure out the masses and perhaps guess what the decay is.\nI have cases.\nI would give you one for your group, and then you’d get another one, and then the **EP one**.\n\n### Score: 90\n\n### Correction:\n*No correction necessary.*\n\n### Comment:\nThe provided content is physically correct and clear. It describes an exercise in decay process identification using kinematic analysis and mass determination without introducing any physics errors. None of the specified flaws (incorrect Mandelstam notation, spin parity misrepresentation, unclear phrases, or irrelevant personal references) appear in this segment. The term \"EP one\" is contextually acceptable as an abbreviation (e.g., for \"Electron-Positron\" or similar), and the pedagogical structure (group assignments, case studies) is logically sound.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","title-prefix":"Hadron
