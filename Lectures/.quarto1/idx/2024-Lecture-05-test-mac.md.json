The blob encapsulates the interaction (strong, electromagnetic, etc.), while arrows indicate incoming/outgoing particles.\n:::\n---\n\n\n**Task:** Calculate the number of variables needed to fully describe the process.\n\n1. **Without spin**:\n- Initial count: 8 (from conservation laws)\n- Subtract 6 (3 rotations + 3 boosts due to frame invariance)\n- **Result:** 2 variables\n\n2. **With spin**:\n- Same as above: **2 variables** (spin orientation doesn’t add independent kinematic variables for 2→2 scattering).\n\n::: callout-important\nThe **scattering amplitude** for spinless particles is a **scalar function** of $s$ and $t$. For particles with spin, it becomes a higher-rank object (e.g., 21-dimensional for $3^- \\times 1^+$), but still depends on **the same two variables**.\n:::\n---\n\n\nThe process is fully described by **two independent Lorentz-invariant variables**. Common choices:\n\n1. **Mandelstam variables**:\n- $s = (P_1 + P_2)^2$ (center-of-mass energy squared)\n- $t = (P_1 - P_3)^2$ (momentum transfer squared)\n- $u = (P_1 - P_4)^2$ (with $s + t + u = \\sum m_i^2$)\n\n2. **Center-of-mass frame variables**:\n- $\\sqrt{s}$ (center-of-mass energy)\n- $\\theta$ (scattering angle between $\\vec{p}_1$ and $\\vec{p}_3$)\n\n::: callout-tip\nAny two **independent** variables work (e.g., lab-frame energies $E_1$, $E_3$), but Mandelstam variables avoid frame-specific distortions.\n:::\n---\n\n\nFor **three-body decay** ($1 \\to 2 + 3 + 4$), the kinematics are similarly described by **two variables**:\n\n- $s_{34} = (P_3 + P_4)^2$\n- $t_{13} = (P_1 - P_3)^2$\n\n**Key properties**:\n\n- The **phase space** is **flat** in Mandelstam variables ($dN/ds_{34}\\,dt_{13} = \\text{constant}$).\n- This makes the **Dalitz plot** a powerful tool for studying dynamics.\n\n---\n\n\nThe **three-body phase space** is given by:\n$$\nd\\Phi_3 = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^5} \\frac{d^3p_2}{2E_2} \\frac{d^3p_3}{2E_3} \\frac{d^3p_4}{2E_4} \\delta^4(P_1 - P_2 - P_3 - P_4)\n$$\n\nUsing the **recursive formula**:\n$$\nd\\Phi_3 = d\\Phi_2(M;m_3,m_4) \\times d\\Phi_2(M\\to m_1; m_2, M_{34}) \\times \\frac{1}{8\\pi^2} ds_{34}\n$$\n\n---\n\n\nThe **Dalitz plot** (plotting $s_{34}$ vs. $t_{13}$) directly reveals dynamics:\n\n- No kinematic distortions in Mandelstam variables.\n- Deviations from flatness indicate **resonances** or **interactions**.\n\n::: callout-note\nThis marks the shift from general particle physics to **hadron-specific** topics, focusing on **spectroscopy** and **three-body decays**.\n:::\n---\n\n\n- **Exercise**: Study the **Dalitz plot** for three-body decays.\n- **Next**: Dive deeper into **angular distributions** and **partial wave analysis**.\n\nQuestions? Let’s discuss before moving on!\n\n### Charm Decay Kinematics and the Dalitz Plot in $\\Lambda_c$ Baryon Decay\n\n\nYou can see the example of the triple decay that I have here: the $\\Lambda_c$ baryon going to the proton, kaon, and pion.\nWe measure $\\Lambda_c$ produced in proton-proton collisions or any other collisions.\nIn the **BES experiment** and **Belle experiment**, they observe $\\Lambda_c$.\nThis is one of those particles that lives a long time and is produced abundantly.\n\n---\n\nParticles with charm ground states are produced abundantly, and they live sufficiently long to fly from the primary vertex.\nWe reconstruct them, which is why we have a good sample and a good understanding of their decay kinematics—and not only kinematics but dynamics as well, the content of this blob.\n\n---\n\nIn that decay, you see there is a charm quark in the initial state and no charm quark in the final state, indicating this happens via **weak interaction**.\nThe charm quark disappears between the initial and final states.\nIt decays, transitioning into the strange quark that ends up in the kaon.\nThe $c \\to s$ transition happens within one generation, so this is **not suppressed**—it’s an allowed process.\n\n::: callout-note\nThe weak decay process involves:\n$$\\Lambda_c^+ \\to p^+ + K^- + \\pi^+$$\n$$c \\to s + W^+ \\quad \\text{(with } W^+ \\to u\\bar{d}\\text{)}$$\n:::\n---\n\nThis is the **golden channel** for detection because, in the final state, you have three charged particles.\nThere are no neutrals.\n\n- The **proton** is a nice charged particle—it travels and is stable.\n- The **kaon** is stable in our accelerator experiments.\n- The **pion** is also stable.\n\nThey fly out from the decay without any distraction, and we see their tracks clearly through all detectors.\nWe observe them pointing away from the primary interaction.\n\n---\n\nThere is roughly a **10-millimeter shift** in $\\Lambda_c$ flight distance between the primary vertex and the secondary vertex—about one centimeter.\nThis is due to the boost and the fact that $\\Lambda_c$ in the laboratory frame lives longer than in its rest frame.\n\n::: callout-note\nThe observed flight path is explained by:\n$$\\Delta x = \\gamma v \\tau_0$$\nwhere $\\gamma = E_{\\Lambda_c}/m_{\\Lambda_c}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n:::\nIt is produced with several hundred GeV in proton-proton collisions at the LHC.\nThis is a very clean decay, and we have studied it extensively.\n\n---\n\nHere is the experimental result of the analysis, which closely resembles the data.\nIf I showed you the actual experimental data, you wouldn’t distinguish it from this plot because the statistics are so high that the distribution is very smooth.\n\nOn the **$x$-axis**, I have the invariant mass squared of the proton and kaon:\n$$m_{pK}^2 = (p_p + p_K)^2$$\n\nOn the **$y$-axis**, I have the invariant mass squared of the kaon and pion:\n$$m_{K\\pi}^2 = (p_K + p_\\pi)^2$$\n\nAll allowed kinematic values for the decay are shown in color.\nThe white area around it corresponds to kinematics where energy and momentum conservation cannot be satisfied.\n\n---\n\nIf I select a point inside the plot, I can compute the angles between particles and their momenta, reconstructing the full 3D decay configuration.\nBut if you give me kinematics in the white area, I immediately see that energy conservation is violated—it’s impossible.\nThis is why the range of possible invariant masses is limited, and this surface is called the **Dalitz plot**.\n\n---\n\nThis is how we explore the kinematics.\nDifferent colors on the plot indicate different probabilities for the decay to occur in specific kinematic configurations.\nWe measure the decay, reconstruct the particle tracks, and determine from which kinematic point it originated because there’s a direct mapping between the four-vectors and the Dalitz plot coordinates.\n\nIt turns out that certain kinematics are more probable than others.\nParticles prefer specific momentum configurations.\n\n---\n\nFor this decay, for example, one kinematic configuration is more likely than another.\nYou should be able to identify this pattern in the plot.\nLet’s take a moment to find it.\n\nThe hint is that particles are aligned in one line at the plot’s boundary.\nInside the surface, they always have an angle between them, but at the boundary, they become collinear.\n\n::: callout-note\nAt the Dalitz plot boundaries:\n$$\\theta_{ij} = 0 \\text{ or } \\pi \\text{ between particles}$$\n:::\nThink: how do you maximize the invariant mass, and where does this point lie on the boundary?\n\n---\n\n### Maximizing and Minimizing Mass in Three-Body Decay Kinematics\n\n\n\nAny thoughts? I think you should be in the bottom right because we should maximize the mass of the PK. There are three momenta going out there. The three momenta are in opposite directions, so the three-momentum of the sum should be as small as possible.\n\nIf we add both momentum vectors, the forward momentum—the sum of the squares—should be as large as possible. We should be on the right of our diagram. If we apply and find... The same direction should be on the lowest.\n\nYou argue that this mass, on the y-axis, should be as small as possible. Why? Because the three momenta are in line, and we subtract them. If you go to their rest frame, the K and π fly next to each other. Their relative momentum is small. If you boost to their rest frame, they might both be at rest. Their mass would just be the sum of the masses, so it's minimum.\n\n::: callout-note\n**Key Relation for Invariant Masses in Three-Body Decay**:\nFor a decay like $\\Lambda_c \\to p K \\pi$, the invariant masses satisfy:\n$$\nm_{12}^2 + m_{23}^2 + m_{13}^2 = m_{\\Lambda_c}^2 + m_p^2 + m_K^2 + m_\\pi^2\n$$\nwhere $m_{ij}$ are the invariant masses of particle pairs.\n:::\nWhat you're saying is correct. We are looking for the minimal mass of the kinematic. Let's figure out what this point corresponds to. There is kinematics like this: two particles with maximal momentum are at rest and go in opposite directions. That corresponds to this one.\n\nThis plot is from experimental data. In the experiment, we would reconstruct such a case because we would not detect the proton. This is the lab frame, but everything we measure is in the lab frame where everything is boosted. Even though the proton is at rest in the lab frame, it's already boosted.\n\n---\n\n\nThis point is the maximum mass. They have maximum momentum and go back-to-back, so this is the maximum mass. This one minimizes the mass. For the three-body decay, there is a similar way to define the angle.\n\nLet me show you the setup. I’m using proton, K, and π. I want to fix the mass of the K-π system. I would like to explore that by changing the mass of the proton.\n\nThink of this in the center-of-momentum frame and boost to the K-π rest frame. In the K-π rest frame, they go back-to-back. In the center-of-momentum frame, three particles are arranged such that the sum of the three-momenta is zero.\n\nOnce I boost, the $\\Lambda_c$ has non-zero momentum. The K and π also have non-zero momentum, but since I am in their rest frame, these two momenta add to zero. If I fix the mass of the system and explore phase space along the line where the mass of this pair is fixed, the length of these vectors is fixed.\n\nWhat is changing? Only the angle $\\theta$. I explore the whole range of the angle from $0$ to $\\pi$. At one corner, $\\theta = 0$; at the other, $\\theta = \\pi$.\n\n---\n\n\nThe right should be zero and the left... Let’s see how you get to that. We fixed the setup where the proton and K-π go in opposite directions. This has the maximum mass of the proton-K system.\n\nFor our new setup, as the length of all vectors is fixed, we can only rotate. The dependence of the mass of two particles on $\\theta$ is such that the wider the angle, the bigger the mass. For the proton-K system, $\\theta = 0$ gives a very high mass. If they go almost in the same direction, they have a small mass.\n\n::: callout-important\n**Invariant Mass Relation for Fixed $m_{K\\pi}$**:\n$$\nm_{pK}^2 = m_{\\Lambda_c}^2 + m_K^2 + m_\\pi^2 - m_{K\\pi}^2 - 2E_{K\\pi}E_p + 2|\\vec{p}_{K\\pi}||\\vec{p}_p|\\cos\\theta\n$$\nwhere $E_i$ and $\\vec{p}_i$ are energies/momenta in the $\\Lambda_c$ rest frame.\n:::\nI can do the same with the other half. Let me fix the mass of the proton-K system again. The most straightforward way to analyze is to go to the rest frame of the proton-K system, where everything is fixed. Then scan along this line by changing the angle of this pair with respect to the rest.\n\nThe lines describe the setup where you change the angle in one frame or another. There is a third variable in the 2-to-2 scattering called U, but it's more symmetric. For three particles, there is the mass of the pion-proton system.\n\nIf I fix the mass of this system and scan the angle, this is easy to understand from the relation that U is a linear combination of the two. The coefficients are one, so it's a diagonal in this plot.\n\n---\n\n\nThis line is the mass of the pion-proton system fixed. I go from one corner to another, changing the representation. The representation we use in experimental analysis for the Dalitz plot has the mass of one pair on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis.\n\nIn the homework, you have an exercise with a more symmetric Dalitz plot where all variables enter symmetrically. This uses properties of an equilateral triangle: every point inside has distances to the sides that sum to a constant.\n\nThe variables—masses of particles—are the distances to the sides. I can look at it like this or like that. This is a super symmetric, nice representation. Essentially, it's the same as this.\n\nThey're not matching because one and another... Wait, should they match? It's a linear transformation, skewed. To plot this, I had to find the relation between Cartesian coordinates and the heights of the triangle.\n\nWhat appears is $\\sqrt{3}/2$ because of the 60° angles. This is a nice symmetric representation, but the other is more common and easier to plot. Both represent the kinematics.\n\nThe objective is to understand the dynamics and processes guiding this interaction. Looking ahead, we realize this process is not just $\\Lambda_c$ decaying to three particles but proceeding via intermediate resonances.\n\nFor a short moment, two particles form an intermediate state that dissociates, increasing the decay probability. These two particles interact more at certain energies, so the probability increases.\n\n---\n\n\nYou might have seen cross sections for two-particle resonances with bumps known as hadronic resonances. The physics is that the quantum numbers of the system match some resonance.\n\nBy adjusting the energy, you explore how likely the particles are to interact. If there is an intermediate resonance, the system resonates at this energy, and the probability increases.\n\nThis leads to bent structures in the Dalitz distribution. Projected onto one axis, you see a resonance-like shape. These bent structures appear in all three pairs.\n\nWhy is there a bigger probability increase when the kaon and pion are near resonance? Let's understand the lines. We’ll come back to this in two lectures.\n\nAll horizontal lines—which resonances are these? In which mass distribution? Horizontal lines in the blue plot correspond to fixed mass for $K\\pi$. These are $K^*$ resonances.\n\nNow, the vertical lines—in which system? When changing $K\\pi$, I scan a certain energy. This corresponds to fixed mass of the proton and $K\\pi$.\n\nThe lines correspond to resonances in $K\\pi$, proton-K, and pion-proton. The other plot helps because the lines are parallel to the sides of the triangle.\n\nThis line is the same as this one, parallel to one side. The lambda resonances are parallel to another side. The delta resonance is parallel to the third side.\n\n---\n\n\nOkay, questions on the angular distribution. To move past this, let’s discuss the angular distribution for a decay within one band.\n\nThe kinematics: traversing the Dalitz plot while keeping the mass fixed changes the angle. This is the kinematics.\n\nIn the rest frame of $K\\pi$, traversing phase space changes this angle. The angle dependence indicates inhomogeneity. Within the band, one edge might have a different probability than the other.\n\nParticles might prefer to be aligned rather than perpendicular. This happens because particles have spin. The intermediate resonance, like $K^*$, is not scalar—it has spin.\n\nSpin causes inhomogeneity in angular distributions and decay spectra.\n\nAngular distribution is a powerful tool to understand particle properties. It measures spin, parity, and other quantum numbers.\n\nHigher-spin particles produce bumpier angular distributions. Scalar particles produce no asymmetries.\n\nIn the rest frame of the decay, examining the ratio of aligned kinematics reveals spin information.\n\nFor most discovered particles, quantum numbers are unknown. We find them as bumps, then determine quantum numbers via angular distributions.\n\nOften, it’s as simple as looking for minima or nodes in the Dalitz plot. Nodes indicate spin: one node for spin-1, two for spin-2, etc.\n\nFor non-scalar particles, it’s more complicated. The proton has spin-½; kaon and pion are spin-0. The $\\Lambda_c$ has spin-½ like the proton.\n\nIf we don’t polarize the initial state or measure the final spin, everything is averaged. No minima or nodes remain—just smeared distributions.\n\n### Rotations, Spin Projections, and Wigner $D$-Functions in Quantum Systems\n\n\nA particle with spin can have $2J + 1$ projections to the quantization axis.\nConsider a particle with spin $J$.\nThere is a $z$-axis that quantizes the spin, and this $z$-axis measures the projection $J_z$.\nThe state $|JM\\rangle$ can be thought of as a vector with $2J + 1$ components.\nAll operators in this case are matrices that act on these vectors, producing either the same state with an eigenvalue or a mixture of states.\n\nWhen a rotation acts on the state, it produces not a single state but a mixture of states.\nIn classical physics, rotating a vector in space can align it to a specific projection, but in quantum mechanics, this is not the case.\nMost rotations result in a superposition of all possible states.\n\nThe coefficients for these superpositions are tabulated and known as **Wigner $D$-functions**.\nLet me be more concrete.\nI will rotate about the $Y$-axis.\nThe coordinate system consists of $X$, $Y$, and $Z$, forming a right-handed triple.\nI will rotate the state $|JM\\rangle$ about the $Y$-axis.\n\nThe operator $J_+$ is represented as $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, and $J_-$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe $J_y$ operator has zeros on the diagonal and off-diagonal elements above and below.\nTo apply the rotation, we take the matrix exponential of $J_y$.\nThis is already computed, and the coefficients $C$ depend on the initial state, which is why the indices $JM$ are kept in the notation.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a spin-1 particle initially perpendicular to the $Y$-axis and rotated by 30 degrees.\nThe resulting state will be a superposition of $|JM\\rangle$ states aligned along the $Y$-axis.\nThe Wigner $D$-functions provide the coefficients for this superposition.\n\nThe general form of the $D$-function for any rotation $R$ is given by Euler angles.\nIn particle physics conventions, we first rotate by $\\phi$ about the $Z$-axis, then by $\\theta$ about the $Y$-axis, and finally by $\\gamma$ about the $Z$-axis again.\nThis sequence describes any orientation in space.\nThe $D$-function decomposes into three parts, with the most complex part coming from the $Y$-axis rotation.\nThe $Z$-axis rotations introduce simple phase factors:\n\n$$\nD^J_{M'M}(\\gamma, \\theta, \\phi) = e^{-i\\gamma M'} d^J_{M'M}(\\theta) e^{-i\\phi M}.\n$$\n\n---\n\n::: callout-note\n**Key Formula**: The Wigner $D$-function for a general rotation (Euler angles $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$) is:\n$$\nD^J_{M'M}(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma) = e^{-iM'\\alpha} d^J_{M'M}(\\beta) e^{-iM\\gamma}.\n$$\n:::\n---\n\nLet’s take a simple example: spin-1/2.\nIf I rotate the state $|1/2, 1/2\\rangle$ by 30 degrees about the $Y$-axis, the result is a superposition of $|1/2, 1/2\\rangle$ and $|1/2, -1/2\\rangle$.\nThe coefficients for this rotation can be found in the same tables as the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, as both are related to the $SU(2)$ group.\n\nFor $j = 1/2$, the $D$-matrix is:\n\n$$\nD^{1/2}_{m'm}(\\theta) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta/2) & -\\sin(\\theta/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta/2) & \\cos(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\nFor 30 degrees ($\\theta/2 = 15^\\circ$), the coefficients are $\\cos(15^\\circ)$ and $\\sin(15^\\circ)$.\n\n---\n\n- Can you compute any rotation of the spin projection?\n- The convention is important—note the minus sign.\n- If you want to compute the matrix exponential yourself, you can use Python or Julia.\n- Alternatively, you can look up tabulated $D$-functions, but be cautious with software like Mathematica, as it may use different conventions.\n- Wikipedia is reliable for checking conventions.\n- The $D$-functions are correctly implemented in SymPy (Python) and ROOT.\n\n---\n\nWhat we’ve discussed so far is about rotations and the rotational group, not weak or strong interactions.\nThis is remarkable because angular distributions in particle decays are determined by **rotational symmetry**, not by the details of the interactions.\nThe only input from strong interactions is the preference for certain spin states.\nThe decay asymmetries and kinematics are governed by the quantum group properties.\nThis allows us to construct general formulas for decay chains and predict angular distributions.\n\n---\n\nNow let’s model the \"blob\" in the decay process.\nAssume a cascade decay where the initial particle decays into an intermediate particle $X$ with spin $J$, which then decays into particles 1 and 2.\nThe amplitude involves summing over intermediate spins and depends on the dimensions:\n\n$$\n(2j_0 + 1) \\times (2j_1 + 1) \\times (2j_2 + 1) \\times (2j_3 + 1).\n$$\n\nIf a particle has spin 0, its dimension is 1.\n\nThe general formula for the amplitude has two parts:\n\n1. A model-independent part from rotational symmetry.\n2. Dynamics-dependent terms $H$ from weak, strong, or electromagnetic interactions.\n\nThe $H$ terms encapsulate the physics of the interactions, while the rest is determined by rotational properties.\nThe helicity states $\\lambda$ are defined with spin quantized along the direction of motion.\n\n---\n\nConsider particle $X$ with spin projection $\\lambda_X$.\nWhen it decays into particles 1 and 2, the quantization axis must be adjusted to match the decay direction.\nThis adjustment is done by rotating the spin state of $X$.\n\nIn aligned kinematics (where $\\phi = \\theta = 0$), the rotation simplifies.\nThe amplitude reduces to:\n\n$$\nA = \\sum_{\\lambda_X} H_{\\lambda_0 \\lambda_X \\lambda_3} \\cdot D^{J_X}_{\\lambda_X, \\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2}(\\theta, \\phi) \\cdot H_{\\lambda_X \\lambda_1 \\lambda_2}.\n$$\n\nFor zero angles, the $D$-function becomes a delta function $\\delta(\\lambda_0 - (\\lambda_X - \\lambda_3))$, enforcing angular momentum conservation.\n\n---\n\nTo predict angular distributions, we need the values of $H$.\nOften, these are approximated as constants in initial analyses.\nThe differential decay rate is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Gamma}{d\\cos\\theta} \\propto |A|^2.\n$$\n\nThe distribution can be flat, parabolic, or another shape, depending on the spin.\n\nExperimentally, we measure $|A|^2$ averaged over initial and final spins.\nTo analyze data, we project the distribution onto Legendre polynomials, a technique called **partial wave analysis**.\nThis helps extract information about the underlying dynamics without knowing $H$ explicitly.\n\n---\n\n::: callout-tip\n**Practical Note**: For further reading on canonical vs. helicity states, refer to Chapter 4 of Martin Spearman’s *Elementary Particle Theory*.\n:::\n---\n\nFinally, here’s an exercise:\nI’ve provided Dalitz plots from CLEO and BaBar without labels.\nYour task is to identify the decays based on kinematics.\nThe axes are labeled, but the particles are not named.\nUse your knowledge of kinematics to deduce the masses and possible decay channels.\n\n### Addressing an Issue and Scheduling Follow-Up\n\n\n\n::: callout-note\n*This portion of the transcript appears to be administrative dialogue about scheduling and materials distribution.*\n:::\n\n- **Speaker 1:** I have to leave because I have an issue.\n- **Speaker 2:** You don't want to take it?
