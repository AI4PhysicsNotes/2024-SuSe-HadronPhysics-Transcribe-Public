You solved them online, but you have to know what to do.\n\n---\n\nLet's discuss quickly question number one. First, the mass of the states.\nThis appears as the particle, right? In this condition, neglecting inelastic channels, this particle is formed by the cascade $C$ and $D$.\nThis particle can travel, can leave. It is a regular particle, but its internal structure is the **hadronic molecule**.\n\nWhat is the mass of this particle? It is the sum.\nIndeed, the mass of the $PCC$ particle—that's how we call them—is roughly the mass of the constituents:\n\n$$\nM_{\\text{PCC}} = M_C + M_D.\n$$\n\nThat's the way we define the binding energy:\n\n$$\nE_{\\text{binding}} = (M_C + M_D) - M_{\\text{PCC}}.\n$$\n\n::: callout-note\n**Binding Energy Clarification**:\nThe binding energy represents the difference between the sum of the constituent masses ($M_C + M_D$) and the mass of the bound state ($M_{\\text{PCC}}$). A small binding energy implies the state sits near the threshold.\n:::\n---\n\nShouldn't it be $PCC$? No, it's $\\overline{PCC}$.\nVery good. It used to be called $PC$, and last year we updated the notations.\nNow it's $PCC$; before it was $PC$ because, with the $C$, you indicate that it contains the charm.\nThis is better—it's really clear.\n\nAs indices, you list heavy quarks because they kind of conserve quantities with the decay.\nLight quarks are... we don't miss them. You can always recover them from the capital letter.\nIf I say $\\Sigma$, you know, that's a capital. The two light quarks, depending on the charge, are either $UU$, $DD$, or $UD$.\nThen $SAP$ means pentaquark—5 quarks.\n$SACC$ is $CC$ plus 3 others.\nFor $PCC$, this is $UD$.\n\n---\n\nLikely, the $PCC$ delta logs we see in this particular channel are of this type—mass of the...\nThis was easy. Neglecting binding energy, you really get the mass of two particles; that's called the threshold.\nThe language we use is saying that the state is... Since the binding energy is small, the state sits at the threshold:\n\n$$\nM_{\\text{PCC}} \\approx M_C + M_D.\n$$\n\nThe hadronic threshold is there. How much is it? Approximately like 10 MeV, 100 MeV.\nWhat's the scale? 10. Less than 10. More than 1.\nThe mass of the $\\Sigma$ is 2.5 or so; the mass of the $D$ is around 2 GeV.\nThe sum is 4.5 GeV. That's roughly where one would search for such formations.\n\n---\n\nNow, quantum numbers, spin algebra—my favorite exercise in this course.\nWe have $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{3}{2}$ instructions.\nParity should be $- -$ because we have $s$-wave. Exactly. Very good.\nSo you expect two states:\n\n$$\nJ^P = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}^-\\right) \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\left(\\frac{3}{2}^-\\right).\n$$\n\n---\n\nThey have a cool lower bound on lifetime.\nWhere does the lower bound really come from? It's the binding of the two constituents.\nAny idea why this state would ever decay and how it would decay actually?\nWhen we talk about lifetime, the particle decays, right? That's what happens with all particles.\n\nHow does this particle decay? I would love to say no, but...\nThe energy of the system is conserved. Once you split it into two, the minimal energy in the system is their mass—$M_C + M_D$.\nThis is already the energy. If they fly apart, the energy is even higher.\nThis is not allowed—energy must be conserved.\n\nWe sit in the rest frame of this particle, and all the energy you have is the mass of this particle.\nThat's it.\n\n::: callout-important\n**Energy Conservation Constraint**:\nThe decay into free constituents is forbidden if the binding energy is positive ($M_{\\text{PCC}} < M_C + M_D$), as the system lacks sufficient energy to separate.\n:::\n### Charm Quark Annihilation, Decay Channels, and Bound State Lifetimes in Heavy Mesons\n\n\nBecause the $c$ and the $\\bar{c}$ undergo **electromagnetic processes**.\nAnnihilation of these two quarks is possible, but this is a **rare process**.\nSince it's an electromagnetic interaction, the probability of this process is much smaller than the process I would like you to consider.\n\n---\n\n**Why have $c \\bar{c}$?** Can they annihilate via the **strong interaction**?\nNo—even if they have different color, they can produce other quarks.\nThis is actually suppressed for heavy particles. The heavier the particles, the smaller the chance for them to annihilate. So this is also **strongly suppressed**.\n\n---\n\nThe three clones appear only for the **color-neutral objects**.\nThe three clones we need to construct the color-neutral object here are living in the **color octet**. It's not singular, so they don't.\nThe strict vertex is a different suppression.\n\n---\n\n::: callout-important\n**The big decay**—that's what happens with this object.\nIf we neglect inelastic channels, the decay of this particle is one of the $c$ quarks transitioning to $s$, emitting the $W$:\n$$ c \\rightarrow s + W^+ $$\nThis is a **big decay**.\n:::\n---\n\nIf the structure of the object is like that, we can even understand the **probability** of this decay happening.\nBig decay is one thing, but there is another transition.\nThis object decays weakly, so it will decay **quickly**. We can compute the lifetime due to that.\n\n---\n\nBut there is another process.\nThis state is not the **ground state**. In the spectrum, we combine quarks $1$, $2$, and $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nWe have $1$ and $0$. The lower one is called $D$, and the upper one is called $D^*$.\nThe transition $D^* \\rightarrow D$ is possible by emitting $\\pi^0$ or $\\gamma$:\n$$ D^* \\rightarrow D + \\pi^0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad D^* \\rightarrow D + \\gamma $$\n\n---\n\nThe **most likely decay channel** is the radiative decay of the $D$.\nThe width is smaller than the width of the $D$, so the lifetime is bigger than the lifetime of the $D^*$.\nThat's a bound.\n\n---\n\nYou combine two objects, and the object lives as long as the constituents—it would live **infinitely** if these particles are stable.\nLike the deuteron is made of a proton and neutron. The proton is stable, and the neutron lives long. The deuteron is stable because the neutron is so bound inside that it cannot decay.\n\n---\n\nThe **binding mechanism** suppresses the phase space of the decay and extends the lifetime of the particle.\nThe $D$ meson here would live longer than the isolated $D^*$ meson.\nThe width of the state is smaller than the width of the $D$, and since the lifetime is the inverse of the width:\n$$ \\tau = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma} $$\nThe lifetime of this object is bigger than the lifetime of the $D$.\n\n---\n\n**Will the $\\Sigma_c^*$ also survive or be an atomic molecule?**\nIt just goes down an energy step instead of falling apart.\n\n---\n\nLet’s try to understand your question.\nYou asked about the cascade $\\Sigma_c^*$ and the $\\Sigma_c + D^0$ molecule. Does this exist? It does.\nSo the molecule can make steps down one energy step—but it can also dissociate into $\\Sigma_D + \\pi$ or $\\Sigma_D + \\gamma$, because the energy for this is a lot:\n$$ \\Sigma_c + D^0 \\rightarrow \\Sigma_D + \\pi \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\Sigma_D + \\gamma $$\n\n---\n\nThe **binding energy** and the situation of the decays are actively discussed in the field.\nAt every conference, you see roughly five talks on this—it's a **really hot subject**.\n\n### Invariant Variables and Kinematics in Four-Legged Processes\n\n\nLet's move to **item number two**.\n*Understand?* The plane is the **plane of invariance**.\n\nFor any reaction with a block—an open direction centered on four legs going out (X, A, B, C)—you can define **invariant variables** that characterize the kinematics.\n\nThe first variable is the mass squared of A and B:\n$$\nS = (p_A + p_B)^2\n$$\nThe mass of A and B is the square root of $S$, so $\\sqrt{S}$ is the mass of the system of particles A and B.\n\nThen:\n$$\nT = (p_B + p_C)^2\n$$\nis the mass squared of the system with particles B and C.\n\nAnd:\n$$\nU = (p_A + p_C)^2\n$$\nis the mass squared of the system with A and C.\n\n---\n\nWe figured out earlier that **two variables** are enough to characterize the kinematics of the four-legged process. This comes from counting degrees of freedom.\n\nThe two variables could be:\n\n- $S$ and $T$\n- $S$ and $U$\n- or any pair.\n\nOn the plane, they are connected because the sum of the three invariants satisfies the **Mandelstam relation**:\n$$\nS + T + U = m_A^2 + m_B^2 + m_C^2 + m_X^2\n$$\n\n---\n\nThe **scattering amplitude** (or transition amplitude) depends on only two variables—$S$ and $T$, $S$ and $U$, or any pair.\n\nThis amplitude is defined as a function on the plane of invariants, and different domains on this plane describe different processes.\n\n::: callout-important\nThe Mandelstam relation shows the interdependence of $S$, $T$, and $U$, constraining the scattering amplitude to depend on only two independent variables.\n:::\n---\n\nBefore proceeding, let's focus on the kinematics and see where A, B, C, and D are located.\n\nThe way I want to solve this is by checking the **signs**:\n\n- For each process, is $S$ greater or less than zero?\n- What about $T$?\n- And $U$?\n\nBy identifying these, we can place the kinematics.\n\n---\n\nLet's consider **process A**.\n\n- Is $S$ positive? **Yes**. Why?\nBecause $S$ is the mass squared of two real particles, and this mass is at least the sum of their masses:\n$$\nS \\geq (m_A + m_B)^2\n$$\nIn the rest frame, the energy of the system is greater than the sum of the masses if they have momentum.\n\nFor A:\n\n- $S > (m_A + m_B)^2$\n- $T \\geq (m_B + m_C)^2$\n- $U \\geq (m_A + m_C)^2$\n\nThe domain for the first kinematics is where $S$, $T$, and $U$ are all greater than their respective thresholds.\n\n---\n\nFor **process B**:\n\n- $T$ is the physical mass squared of two particles, so $T > 0$ and $T \\geq (m_B + m_C)^2$.\n\n---\n\nTo discuss the kinematics of **cross-channel reactions** (like A, M, D, E particles), we can swap momenta.\n\nFor particles moving to the other side, we modify the definition of the invariants by **flipping the sign** of their momenta.\n\n*This is what Ares mentioned—you could redefine the invariants accordingly.*\n\n### Kinematic Domains, Dalitz Plots, and the Kibble Function in Scattering Amplitudes\n\n\nTwo different directions, and then the sum minus $S$ would appear in the first place there.\nWe could start with this direction. The place for this is when $T$ is more than zero, because $T$ is the physical mass of two particles.\nAnd then $S$ is under $A$ and $B$. This is kind of an impossible combination. They are on different sides, and the variable $S$ is going to be less than zero, and then $U$ is less than zero.\nSo it's another impossible combination, and the domain, roughly speaking, is where $U$ is below zero. And then $S$ is above, $T$ is above zero.\n\nHere's $T$. So $T$ is this direction. And then $S$ is above zero. This and $U$ is above zero.\nThis color has, so here this is the minimum. So this one is $B$, and same on the $C$. And then another one, $D$, where is $D$? $A + C$, $X + B$.\n$A$ and $C$ give us the $U$-channel. So this is the positive. $U$ is positive.\n\n---\n\n::: callout-important\nThe Kibble/Klein function describing physical domain contours:\n$$\n\\Phi(s,t,u) = s^2 + t^2 + u^2 - 2st - 2tu - 2us\n$$\nThis single function can generate all boundary lines when solved for $\\Phi(S, T, U) = 0$.\n:::\n---\n\nAnd now to see real physical contours for the kinematics. One has to calculate what are the physical ranges of scattering variables.\nLike if you work in the cosine of the scattering angle, by placing the restriction that cosine must be from $-1$ to $1$, you identify that the border is such that not all points here are allowed, but only a certain region.\nAnd then the true border for the scattering is often given by this sixth-order polynomial.\n\nIn the center is this canvas. This is our Dalitz plot. This is here. And then another direction could be here. So 1, 2, 3, 4.\nFour regions for physical reactions that are happening.\nIt's important to realize that connection because there's just a single amplitude matrix element that describes all four.\nSo if you get this function and constrain it precisely, it describes all four.\nJust define it on this domain, and for every point you can compute, it gives you the complex number $1 + 3i$.\nAnd then this is the value of the quantum transition amplitude. The matrix element you can compute at a different place.\nNow we have a complex transition amplitude for the decay. I think that's super cool.\n\nIt works very well in QED. When you consider Compton scattering, photon-electron going to photon-electron, this is a crossed process.\nAnd it's exactly the same matrix element that describes the electron-positron annihilation to two photons.\nAnd it's exactly the same process that describes two-photon production of an electron-positron pair in quantum electrodynamics.\n\n---\n\nIn hadron physics, it's a little bit more complicated. Since we have perturbation theory, we always model.\nSo what we are going to do when we describe the Dalitz plot, we model it in terms of the chunk of the resonances.\nAnd then you find that once you want to compute this function right here, the scattering amplitude, it blows up.\nIt has infinities, so it has unphysical behavior.\nThe reason is because we employ a finite range of finite number of resonances, and the physics is more complicated analytically.\n\nThe fact that this amplitude is related to that domain tells you already that you have to put an infinite number of resonances.\nLike we saw the lines on the dispersion, these are all resonances.\nAnd in order to relate this in this domain, you have to operate with the infinite sums, and then in infinite terms they would compensate each other and you have a reasonable amplitude.\n\nThere has been an effort for now, 30 years, 50 years, of finding such a set of functions that works everywhere nicely and is analytic and reasonable.\nWhat's most difficult is to come up with something that describes the data, because there is Regge theory.\nYou might have heard of Regge theory, and this is one of the approaches.\nSo you come up with a complex function that has all the nice properties—it works reasonably on scattering domains and it works in the decay domain.\nHowever, of course it lacks exact understanding of the resonance properties.\nLike it would put resonances there that have zero width in Regge theory.\nAnd one of the interesting developments is to implement resonances with widths.\n\n---\n\nOne more thing. If you like playing with functions, there is a very simple expression that describes contours of the physical domain.\nThis is called the Kibble function. I think it's worth giving.\nThere is just one function. If you solve $\\Phi(S, T, U) = 0$, you find this line, that line, that line, and that line.\nJust one function—put it into a solver, and for any given value of $S$...\nSo let's fix $S$. Where is our $S$? Let's fix $S$ to be $-50$.\nWe're going to get two solutions. One of them... Let's put $S = +20$.\nThen you have two solutions using this.\n\nThis function is really easy to type into code. This is the Klein function or Kibble function.\nIt's almost a complete polynomial, but it misses more terms of this table.\nSo it's:\n\n$$\n\\Phi(s, t, u) = s^2 + t^2 + u^2 - 2st - 2tu - 2us\n$$\n\nThis is called the Kibble or Klein function.\n\nThe Kibble function is the combination of three Kibble functions, where every $\\Lambda_1$, $\\Lambda_2$, and $\\Lambda_3$ corresponds to a different channel.\nSo $\\Lambda_2$ is then for $B$—it's $\\Lambda(T, m_0^2, m_X^2)$.\nAnd here is the... what's missing? Mass and $T$.\nAnd then $\\Lambda_3$ is $\\Lambda(U, m_X^2, m_B^2)$.\n\nSo then you go to Wolfram Alpha and say, \"Give me a contour plot.\" And then you form them and you find all this function and discussion on that in the Pikkuharju-Kalenti book.\nHave we discussed this book? The best book on particle kinematics is written by two authors with unspellable family names.\nUnspellable. And this is—if I got it right—see Bikulov-Janti. No, cycling? No.\nYes, correct me. But the book is excellent.\nSo if you get a chance to get yourself this, you know everything about particle kinematics, particularly very peculiar properties of the Kibble function and the Challenger function.\n\n### Unitarity as a Constraint on Scattering Amplitudes\n\n\nWe are ready to move to the topic of today: **unitarity**.\nUnitarity is a **constraint on the scattering amplitude**.\nIn heavy physics, we don't compute the scattering amplitude from first principles but rather model it. Our guiding principles are what this amplitude *can* be and what it *should* be.\n\n::: callout-important\nYou cannot just write down an arbitrary expression for the amplitude that fits the data. There are some principles, and one of them is **probability conservation**.\nProbability conservation translates into the mathematical statement on the amplitude known as unitarity.\n:::\nYou might have seen earlier in the particle scattering course the **optical theorem**, which relates the imaginary part of the amplitude to the total cross section. It essentially states that the imaginary part is equal to the coefficient of the total cross section:\n\n$$\n\\text{Im}\\, \\mathcal{M}(s, t=0) = 2k\\sqrt{s}\\, \\sigma_{\\text{tot}}(s),\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n- $\\mathcal{M}$ is the scattering amplitude,\n- $s$ is the Mandelstam variable,\n- $k$ is the momentum,\n- $\\sigma_{\\text{tot}}$ is the total cross section.\n\nThis is a consequence of unitarity—a consequence of **probability conservation**.\nIt is so important, this very powerful statement, that just this principle alone allows you to derive a decent low-energy scattering amplitude that describes all of the resonance phenomena.\n\n---\n\nYou see the bump in the spectrum due to **probability conservation**. You know what expression you should take to describe this phenomenon.\nMoreover, since unitarity is about the **analytic properties** of the amplitude, it tells you what the analytic structure of the amplitude is.\n\nIn the last lecture, we briefly discussed **analytic functions** and what singularities they might have, like cuts or branch points.\nUnitarity also tells you the **location of the singularities** in the complex plane.\nThis comes from the fact that we are dealing with **real unitary functions**—functions for which the imaginary part determines the locations of the cuts.\n\n---\n\n1. **Unitarity condition for the S-matrix**:\n$$\nS^\\dagger S = I\n$$\nwhere $S$ is the scattering matrix and $I$ is the identity matrix.\n\n2. **Partial wave expansion and unitarity** (for elastic scattering):\n$$\n\\text{Im}\\, f_l(s) = k |f_l(s)|^2\n$$\nwhere $f_l(s)$ is the partial wave amplitude for angular momentum $l$.\n\n3. **Branch cut structure due to unitarity**:\n$$\n\\text{Disc}\\, \\mathcal{M}(s) = 2i\\, \\text{Im}\\, \\mathcal{M}(s)\n$$\nwhere $\\text{Disc}\\, \\mathcal{M}(s)$ is the discontinuity across the branch cut.\n\n### Unitarity Constraints on Scattering Amplitudes and Partial Wave Expansion\n\n\nLet's get there step by step, starting with the **scattering amplitude** and **partial waves**. For the sake of time, let me first state where we arrive, and then we can derive it. We will derive the following three equations, all dealing with scattering amplitudes.\n\n---\n\nThe first equation describes how unitarity acts on the full amplitude. The scattering amplitude $A$ describes a process, and unitarity tells us:\n\n$$\nA - A^* = i \\int A^* A \\, d\\Phi,\n$$\n\nwhere $d\\Phi$ is the **phase space** of the intermediate state. Diagrammatically, this represents the relationship between the amplitude and its complex conjugate.\n\n---\n\nFor partial waves, the amplitude $A$ becomes a function of a single variable. We can simplify the phase space and find:\n\n$$\nA - A^* = i \\rho(s) |A|^2,\n$$\n\nwhere $\\rho(s)$ is the **phase space factor**. This tells us that the **imaginary part** of the amplitude is related to the squared amplitude.\n\n---\n\nNow, let's derive these expressions. We start with the scattering amplitude for a **2-to-2 elastic scattering process**. On the board, I draw a diagram where a blob represents the interaction between two particles. Below it is the kinematic representation in the **center-of-mass frame**, where the total momentum is zero.\n\nIn the center-of-mass frame, the momenta of the particles are equal, even if their masses differ. The momentum is given by:\n\n$$\np = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\lambda(s, m_1^2, m_2^2)}}{2\\sqrt{s}},\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the **Källén function**. After the interaction, the particles have the same masses and momenta, but the **scattering angle** changes.\n\n---\n\nThe observable for these interactions is the **angular distribution**. For 2-to-2 scattering, once the energy is fixed, the only variable is the scattering angle $\\theta$. The amplitude depends on $\\theta$ and the energy $s$.\n\nThe scattering amplitude is defined as the matrix element:\n\n$$\n\\langle p_1', p_2' | p_1, p_2 \\rangle,\n$$\n\nwith **energy-momentum conservation** enforced by delta functions. The phase space for two-body scattering is:\n\n$$\nd\\Phi_2 = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^2} \\frac{p}{4\\sqrt{s}} \\, d\\cos\\theta \\, d\\phi.\n$$\n\nThe identity operator integrates over all possible angles, ensuring normalization. The two-body phase space covers all directions on the sphere, representing the **4π solid angle**.\n\n---\n\nUnitarity is a statement about the scattering operator. We separate the trivial part (identity) from the interaction part $T$, defining the scattering amplitude. The unitary condition for $T$ is:\n\n$$\nT - T^\\dagger = i T^\\dagger T.\n$$\n\nThis leads to the **general unitarity relation**:\n\n$$\nA - A^* = i \\int A^* A \\, d\\Phi.\n$$\n\n---\n\nFor partial waves, we expand the amplitude in **Legendre polynomials**:\n\n$$\nA(s, \\theta) = \\sum_{j=0}^\\infty (2j + 1) A_j(s) P_j(\\cos\\theta).\n$$\n\nThe partial wave amplitudes $A_j(s)$ are constrained by unitarity:\n\n$$\n\\text{Im}\\, A_j(s) = \\rho(s) |A_j(s)|^2.\n$$\n\n::: callout-note\nThis expansion converges well for **strong interactions**, as high-$j$ contributions are suppressed by the size of hadrons. In experiments, only a few partial waves are needed to describe the data—often fewer than ten. This makes the partial wave expansion a **powerful and practical tool**.\n:::\n### Properties and Independence of Partial Wave Amplitudes\n\n\nAnother thing that appears here is the **partial wave amplitude**.\nThis amplitude is a function of a **single variable** (*k*, the momentum).\nFor every partial wave, there is one function of one variable.\nEach partial wave has **fixed quantum numbers** (*l*, the angular momentum quantum number).\n\n::: callout-important\nThe partial wave amplitude for angular momentum *l* is given by:\n$$f_l(k) = \\frac{e^{i\\delta_l(k)} \\sin \\delta_l(k)}{k},$$\nwhere $\\delta_l(k)$ is the phase shift for partial wave *l*.\n:::\nA large advantage of partial waves is that they **do not interact** with each other.\nThey don't influence each other.\nEvery partial wave is **independent**.\n\nSince quantum numbers in scattering are **conserved**, partial waves in the initial state are only related to partial waves in the final state with the **same quantum numbers**.\nIn the unitarity constraint, you will see that it's actually a **single partial wave** that relates to its output.\n\n::: callout-note\nThe unitarity constraint shows their independence:\n$$|S_l(k)|^2 = 1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad S_l(k) = e^{2i\\delta_l(k)},$$\nwhere $S_l(k)$ is the S-matrix element for partial wave *l*.\n:::\nThere is **no overlap** between waves.\nThey don't mix.\n\n---\n\n1. The partial wave amplitude for angular momentum $l$ is given by:\n$$\nf_l(k) = \\frac{e^{i\\delta_l(k)} \\sin \\delta_l(k)}{k},\n$$\nwhere $f_l(k)$ is the scattering amplitude, $k$ is the momentum, and $\\delta_l(k)$ is the phase shift.\n\n2. The unitarity constraint shows their independence:\n$$\n|S_l(k)|^2 = 1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad S_l(k) = e^{2i\\delta_l(k)}.\n$$\n\n3. The cross section in terms of partial waves is:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{4\\pi}{k^2} \\sum_{l=0}^\\infty (2l + 1) \\sin^2 \\delta_l(k).\n$$\n\nThese formulas highlight how partial waves are functions of a **single variable** ($k$), have **fixed quantum numbers** ($l$), and remain **independent** under unitarity constraints.\n\n### Resonance Phenomenon and Partial Wave Expansion in Scattering Amplitudes\n\n\nAnd the way we can proceed is to insert this here and then simplify the phase space.\nFor this, you will need one **magic formula**, and I don't have time to derive it.\nIt's actually present in many references. I will send you the details.\n\nBut there is a **really cool relation** that I would like you to see: when we insert it there, the initial state is like this.\nIt has the angle zero. That means its state is like this.\nThen, the final state is like that.\n\nFor the final state, the Legendre polynomial $P_J$ is a function of $\\theta$ or the cosine.\n$\\theta$ is the same as the big Wigner $D$-function for $D^J_{00}(\\cos\\theta)$.\nWrite it first differently.\n\nWe know the Wigner $D$-function of $J$ of $P$ vector is still important in $Q$ vector, and it's equal to $D(P) \\times D(Q)$.\nSo, $D^J_{0\\lambda}$—such a **cool and powerful expression**.\n\nHere, the capital $G$ where $\\lambda$ is $00$ is equal to $e^{-i\\theta}$.\nIt's just the definition of the capital $G$ function: the first argument is the phase, the second (or last) argument is the phase, but here it's zero.\n\n::: callout-note\nThe Wigner D-function relation shows how angular momentum states transform:\n$$ D^J_{0\\lambda}(\\theta) = P_J(\\cos\\theta) $$\nwhere $P_J$ is the Legendre polynomial.\n:::\nAnd then the indices—for this, what happens is that you have to integrate over all possible intermediate steps, and both of the amplitudes are expanded in the partial waves.\nThe way to do this is to expand the cosine between the first and second and the last into the composition of intermediate steps.\nAnd that's exactly the functions we need to relate this amplitude to the partial wave expansion.\n\nBut the expression we arrived at in partial wave theory—well, you are not surprised by the numerical coefficients because it's simply the base case.\nSo, what's done now is to divide the right part by... multiply both parts with $\\frac{1}{a_J}$, so this vanishes.\nThen this one is $\\frac{1}{a_J^*}$.\nAnd then the minus $N$ comes from that.\n\nAnd then the imaginary part of the partial amplitude is just $i^{-L}$.\nIt's amazing because it tells us exactly how the inverse amplitude—how the imaginary part of the inverse amplitude—looks like.\n\n---\n\nSo, let's maybe plot it.\nHere's $s$.\nHere is the imaginary part of $a_J$ and the phase space function.\n\nThe phase space factor we have here is the function that starts from threshold and approaches $\\frac{1}{16\\pi}$ at infinity.\nAt threshold, it has a **square root behavior**: $\\sqrt{s - (M_1 + M_2)^2}$.\nSo it starts as a square root but then approaches a constant, $\\frac{1}{16\\pi}$, or $\\frac{1}{8\\pi} \\frac{\\lambda^{1/2}}{s}$.\n\nSince $P$ is a channel function, then this is... and this is something that goes to one at high energy.\n\n---\n\nAnd now, I think I managed to tell you the last thing: the modeling.\nWe know the imaginary part. We do not know the real part.\nThe real part of the amplitude is something that is **genuine to the interaction**.\n\nWhat we have done so far is the same for:\n\n- Electromagnetic interactions\n- Strong interactions\n- Gravity interactions—whatever interactions.\n\nAny interaction that has unitarity must have an imaginary part related to the phase space.\nBut the real part of the amplitude is something you have to compute or model.\n\nPeople working on theory extract the real part of the amplitude by analyzing the lattice data.\nPeople working in experiments extract the real part by analyzing the harmonic data.\n\nAnd the simplest model—or actually, what we have to write—is the inverse amplitude is equal to... some real function that we do a...\nIs it legal? Is this correct? Yes, any real function.\n\nAnd then, one of the options for this real function is the pole—one of the simplest approximations.\nSo this is a real function. We take it.\n\nThe amplitude computed assuming the real part is a single pole is called the **Breit-Wigner amplitude**, and this is a **relativistic Breit-Wigner amplitude**.\n\nNow, I'm looking... so let's do $K$-matrix poles—the amplitude that...\nActually, modeling the amplitude in terms of pole terms is often called the $K$-matrix approach.\n\n---\n\nLet me plot this unperturbed amplitude.\nHere, I'm going to have the absolute value of $A$ on the $Y$-axis and $L$.\nAnd $M$ is a parameter that I put in.\nSo these are both real numbers.\n\nIt gives me the meaning of the least real numbers that I put in my real function.\nThe numerator, the $g$, determines how broad the peak is going to appear.\nAnd then $M$ is often called the **bare mass**—the mass at which the peak appears.\n\nAnd that's the simplest resonance amplitude I can come up with.\nSo this describes a resonant phenomenon, describes the phenomenon where what is inside of the block is an intermediate resonance.\n\nParticles come toward each other, smash into each other, form an intermediate resonance for a short moment, and then decay.\nAlso, it's not clear why we call this a resonance phenomenon.\n\nBut imagine you have two particles, and you can bring them together, let them interact, and measure the probability for them to interact.\nAnd you have a handle to tune the energy of the particles.\n\nSo essentially, in the experiment, you do the following: you smash particles and count in how many cases they interact—they do scatter.\nThen you're going to observe something like that, where the $X$-axis would be the probability for them to interact, and the $Y$-axis is the energy with which you collide them.\n\nIf you collide at this energy, the probability to interact is small.\nBut once you tune the energy to the mass of the resonance frequency—the mass of the resonance—you have a huge cross-section, and then it dies out again.\n\nSo this resonance phenomenon indicates that there is something interesting inside the plot of my interactions—namely, a particle, an intermediate particle that can be formed.\n\n### Poles, Zeros, and Unitarity in Scattering Amplitudes\n\n\nNow, what happens from the two-part $2 \\times K$ matrix is the two poles. The cross section looks now something like that. It has two peaks:\n\n- The **first peak** corresponds to the first pole.\n- The **second peak** corresponds to the second pole.\n\nThere is a **zero in between**, which comes from the fact that $K$ vanishes.\n\n::: callout-note\nThe lecturer corrects a typo:\n\n- Originally written: $K$\n- Corrected to: $K^{-1}$\n\nThe average expression should be $1 - \\rho \\cdot (K^{-1})$. Then, $K$ multiplies this expression.\n:::\nIf $K$ vanishes, the entire expression vanishes, therefore two poles. If you call $K$ itself, it has one singularity and then it gives another set. In order to reach the second singular asymptotics, it needs to cross the zero.\n\nSo $K$ vanishes in between the poles, and the zero propagates with the amplitude squared. What is this amplitude? **Zero**, not plus zero. Very good. This is zero on this axis.\n\n---\n\nWell, another thing to note is that the values of the energy where amplified peaks occur are not exactly these masses. You see, they enter an expression in a rather complicated form. Therefore:\n\n- The peak happens **very close** to this value.\n- But **not exactly** at that value.\n\nThat's the reason why this mass is sometimes called **bare masses**. This process of putting into the expression is addressing of bare particle masses with the propagator within the dressing process.\n\n---\n\nLet's have another look at this expression:\n\n$$\nA = \\frac{K}{1 - \\rho \\cdot K}\n$$\n\nWhen we expand this in the Taylor series, it's going to be:\n\n$$\nA = K + K \\cdot \\rho \\cdot K + K \\cdot \\rho \\cdot K \\cdot \\rho \\cdot K + \\cdots\n$$\n\nWhat we see is an infinite series of terms that allows us to give a meaning to the terms $K$ and $\\rho$:\n\n- $\\rho$ comes from the **two-particle phase space** and indicates two particles propagating.\n- The $K$-term is the **elementary interaction**—$K$ is the point-like interaction.\n\n**Diagrammatically**:\n\n- $\\rho$ is the 2-particle parameter.\n- $K$ is the elementary interaction.\n\n---\n\nThe vertex amplitude is a **complex function**. What we've discussed so far is how the **length** of this complex vector looks like. But what we haven't discussed is the **angle**—the scattering phase, the argument of the scattering amplitude.\n\nThe scattering phase also has interesting behavior. It actually makes a **circle in the complex plane**.\n\n---\n\nWhat you see here is that from threshold, the amplitude increases. If you draw it in the complex plane:\n\n1. It starts small.\n2. Then increases to its largest value.\n3. Then goes down and arrives again at zero.\n4. Then makes a second shape like that—where the variable $A$ here is the **imaginary part of $A$**.\n\nWhat I'm showing here is the function of $s$. The maximal value is approached around $m_1^2$. Then there is the second circle that the amplitude makes, completing this shape. This is called an **Argand diagram**.\n\n---\n\nThere is more in the homework sheet I've set. The Argand diagram is simply plotting the amplitude or amplitude times $\\rho$.\n\n$$\nF = A \\cdot \\rho\n$$\n\nThat's just a more convenient quantity to plot in the complex plane.\n\n---\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- **Unitarity** is an important constraint that comes from **probability conservation**.\n- It practically gives us a tool to model the amplitude.\n- It tells us that the **imaginary part** of the amplitude is fixed, and we only have to worry about the **real part**.\n\nMoreover, this real part has the meaning of a **point-like interaction** that has to be resumed to all orders. The way to model this—there are many techniques to model the real part, and one of them is at the end discussed now.\n\nAnother one is the modeling with the polynomial, and this is called the **scattering length approximation**. The first term would be the scattering length. The second—so you can write:\n\n$$\nK^{-1} = a^{-1} + \\frac{r_s r_p}{2}k^2\n$$\n\nand this is called the **effective range approximation**.\n\n---\n\n::: callout-important\nKey formulas discussed:\n\n- Amplitude: $A = \\frac{K}{1 - \\rho \\cdot K}$\n- Unitarity condition: $\\text{Im}\\, A = \\rho |A|^2$\n- Effective range approximation: $K^{-1} = a^{-1} + \\frac{r_s r_p}{2}k^2$\n:::\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","title-prefix":"Hadron
