The models that approximate Lagrangians—we'll discuss:\n\n- **Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT)**: A low-energy effective field theory.\nThe leading-order Lagrangian is:\n$$\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{ChPT}} = \\frac{F_\\pi^2}{4} \\text{Tr}[\\partial_\\mu U \\partial^\\mu U^\\dagger] + \\frac{F_\\pi^2 B_0}{2} \\text{Tr}[M(U + U^\\dagger)]$$\nwhere $U$ is the chiral field, $F_\\pi$ the pion decay constant, and $B_0$ relates to the quark condensate.\n\n- **pNRQCD**: A non-relativistic effective field theory for charmonium states.\nThe Hamiltonian for heavy quarkonia is:\n$$H_{\\text{pNRQCD}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{p}^2}{m_Q} + V(r) + \\mathcal{O}(1/m_Q^2)$$\nwhere $m_Q$ is the heavy quark mass and $V(r)$ is the QCD potential.\n\n- **Lattice QCD**: We'll explore its methods and applications in hadron spectroscopy.\nThe action for Wilson fermions is:\n$$S_{\\text{LQCD}} = \\sum_{x} \\bar{\\psi}(x) D_W \\psi(x) + S_G[U]$$\nwith $D_W$ as the Wilson-Dirac operator and $S_G$ the gauge action.\n\n---\n\nI would like to spend one more lecture on **B meson** and **D meson** physics, where hadron physics plays a crucial role.\nWhile these studies often focus on **CP violation** and searches for **new physics beyond the Standard Model**, hadron physics provides essential input on strong interactions.\n\n::: callout-important\nThe **weak decay amplitude** for $B \\to f$ transitions is:\n$$\\mathcal{A}(B \\to f) = \\langle f|\\mathcal{H}_{\\text{weak}}|B\\rangle = V_{ub} V_{uq}^* \\mathcal{M}_{\\text{strong}}$$\nHere, $\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{strong}}$ encodes hadronic matrix elements, emphasizing the need to understand strong phases.\n:::\nDetermining weak phases almost always requires knowledge of the **strong phase** of the transition.\nUnderstanding how hadrons form and their properties is key.\n\n---\n\nI think we have **four more lectures** to go, possibly fewer.\nI plan for four, aiming to finish in the **first week of July**.\nThe **16th** is a spare lecture in case we need additional discussion.\nBut the **9th of July** is marked as the last lecture on my calendar.\n\nDoes the semester usually run until mid- or late July? I forget the exact schedule.\nIn my calendar, the semester extends until the **third week of July**.\nSo the **9th, 16th, and even the 23rd** are still part of the semester.\nHowever, a research school in Bochum will occupy our time, so we aim to finish one week earlier.\n\n### Unitarity Constraints on Partial Amplitudes and the Argand Diagram\n\n\n\nToday's lecture—**lecture number one**—will start with the **theoretical unitarity**. We'll discuss the **threshold expansion**, particularly amplitude behavior at the threshold, as well as the **scattering length approximation**. Then we'll move to **effective field theory (EFT)** and compare **EFT and unitarity**. Finally, we'll cover **ππ scattering in S-wave**, where the current perturbation theory gives us the scattering amplitude.\n\n---\n\n\nThe first question is:\n*Which values are allowed for the transition as partial amplitude* $F = T \\rho$, *where* $T$ *is the scattering amplitude?*\n\n- **Consistency is important**. The scattering amplitude is the scattering amplitude, and this is the partial amplitude.\n- If you don't have any clue for the first one, you might just—if you don't do homework, you have no clue for the first one, probably.\n- The second one is standard, something we discussed many times.\n\nLet's start with **number two**. First, each partial wave—you can just speak aloud. What are your thoughts? What do you think?\n\n---\n\n\nWe noted last time that we want the function to be **analytical on the right-hand side**, and $A$ isn't analytic in this region. If I put $F$ plane, where is $F$? It's $3 - 2A$. This one is here, somewhere at 45 degrees. And this one is $-1$.\n\nIt was just the golden ratio but with an $i$ in it. No, it's not the golden ratio, but I thought it was $1 + \\sqrt{2}$ divided by—it's $\\sqrt{5}/2$ for the golden ratio. That would have been a point where I could have said it's just invented by you. But it's important to understand the principle—**what's allowed when you talk about something being allowed**.\n\n---\n\n::: callout-important\n**Unitarity and the Argand Diagram**\n\n- Unitarity tells us that the imaginary part of the amplitude is driven by the interaction loop.\n- The imaginary part of the inverse amplitude is given by:\n  $$ \\text{Im}(T^{-1}) = -\\rho $$\n\n- The amplitude can be written as:\n  $$ T = \\frac{e^{i\\delta} \\sin \\delta}{\\rho} $$\n\n- For elastic scattering, the amplitude lies on a **unitarity circle** in the complex plane.\n:::\n---\n\n\nThis is about **unitarity**, and I would like to use unitarity here. Last time, and also in the homework exercise sheets, we've seen the **Argand diagram**. This is how we determine the values of the amplitude when you plot them in the complex plane.\n\nFor **regular resonances**, the amplitude makes a circle. Unitarity tells us that the imaginary part of the amplitude is driven by the interaction loop, and it's only determined. The imaginary part of the inverse amplitude from this relation is simply $-\\rho$, and the amplitude can be written as an inner real function—a real function without singularities—minus $\\rho$. From that, once you plot the amplitude, you end up on a circle.\n\nHow do you see that? This is $A$ in terms of $F$, or this is $T$, and what I want is atoms. So my $F$ is $A \\times \\rho$. We haven't done this last time, but it's a straightforward exercise to see that such an amplitude is actually sitting on the circle. **Only values that the amplitude can have are on the circle**.\n\nTo see that, one takes this general form and divides by $\\rho$, replaces $\\rho$ by its form in terms of $\\delta$, and ends up with something very simple: $\\sin \\delta \\, e^{i \\delta}$. This is the only possible value of $W$. You can write it differently: $e^{2i \\delta}/2 - \\dots$.\n\nWhen $\\delta = 0$, this is zero. When $\\delta$ reaches its maximum value, which is $\\pi/2$, this is $1$, and $e^{i \\pi/2} = i$. So it reaches the maximum value at $i$.\n\nWhen $\\delta = \\pi/2$, this is $e^{2 \\pi i} = -1$. But something doesn't work. Between this and this, I made a mistake. The numerator is $i/2$, and then you have $1 - e^{2i \\delta}$. This is straightforward to see what's happening. You are sitting—and if this distance term were absent, you'd have $i/2$. But this term gives you a shift in the delta direction, and you move along this circle.\n\nHere is $\\delta = 0$, here is $\\delta = \\pi/2$, and then you move on. Here is $\\delta = \\pi$. This is the **Argand diagram**.\n\n---\n\n\nFor the **elastic amplitude**—where you have only one channel—all allowed values of the amplitude are located along this circle. There are no other possible ways. Among this list, none of them are sitting on the circle. For the single scattering amplitude, none of them would be allowed values from unitarity.\n\nFor **non-elastic scattering**—where particles can transition to other channels—values inside the circle are also allowed. Unitarity tells you that for elastic channels, only the circle is allowed. For inelastic scattering, all values inside the circle are allowed.\n\nYou look at the list and quickly see which are inside, which are not. I've already put the values on the complex plane. $A$ is not, $B$ is in. To arrive at the center, you need some inelastic channels. It cannot be $\\pi \\pi$ to $\\pi \\pi$. It must be—below the first elastic threshold, the next one is outside. But to make it inside, I think if I put it over eight, this is inside, so $B$ is also valid. $D$ is here, and it's even in the negative domain. I have to modify something significantly to make it inside. Put a plus here, perhaps. Then I'm not sure if it sits inside or outside.\n\n---\n\n\n**Questions?** $\\delta$ is the **scattering phase**, a really important quantity in quantum mechanics. You consider a plane wave that interacts with the source, and there is a spherical wave with the scattering phase. This is exactly the same phase. It determines the scattering.\n\n- If $\\delta = 0$, that is essentially trivial—**no scattering**.\n- This phase determines the **strength of your scattering**.\n\n### Unitarity and Partial Wave Expansions in Scattering Amplitudes\n\n\nIs this representation correct? Isn't this just the $T$-matrix represented as the $S$-matrix? This \"$ \\frac{i}{2}(1 - e^{2i \\delta}) $,\" so just this.\n\nIn my bachelor's, I've seen it or used it as the on-shell representation of the $T$-matrix.\nBut it's not. Not this.\n\nFor the $S$-matrix, you have just the phase, no sign.\nThat's why I said it's the $T$-matrix represented as written.\nYes, that's exactly the $T$-matrix that I discussed.\n\nNow, this $T$ is the expectation of the $T$-matrix.\nBecause there's also the physical factor $\\rho$ in it, but maybe it just dropped out.\nRight, exactly.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the same thing appears, but instead of $\\rho$, we have $K$, the wave number for the breakup momentum, which is also part of $\\rho$.\nThe factor is slightly different, but $P$ is the breakup momentum.\nThat's what you see in the quantum mechanics derivation.\n\nThere is no \"$ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{s}} $.\" This is a relativistic factor that only appears in relativistic scattering.\nOverall, it's a normalization constant. But you're absolutely right.\n\nFrom that, you also see the $T$-matrix. The relation between them is $S = 1 + i \\rho T$.\nSo the $S$-matrix is $S = 1 + 2i \\rho T$.\nWhen you substitute this, you should have just $e^{2i \\delta}$.\nThen you see that unitarity is satisfied with $S^\\dagger S = 1$.\n\n---\n\n::: callout-important\nKey formulas discussed:\n\n- $T = \\frac{i}{2}(1 - e^{2i\\delta})$\n- $S = 1 + 2i\\rho T$\n- Unitarity condition: $S^\\dagger S = 1$\n:::\n---\n\nQuickly, exercise number two: in which case does this happen? For the sake of time, we should move on.\n\nThe first one applies to all of them.\nTo determine that, you do simple spin algebra:\n\n- $0^- \\rightarrow 1^-$ is a $P$-wave.\n- $2^+ \\rightarrow 0^-$.\n- $1^- \\rightarrow 0^-$.\n\nHere, $2^+ \\rightarrow 0^+$ in $S$-wave would be $2^-$.\nBut the answer is... Oh, that's interesting.\n\nFor the first one in the $P$-wave, these two combine to $1^-$, matching the quantum numbers of the $\\rho$ meson.\nThe $\\rho$ meson is $1^-$, and this decay conserves parity.\n\nThe second one is electromagnetic.\nIf you combine $2^+$ and $0^+$ in $S$-wave, you get $2^-$.\nIn $D$-wave, you can have $0^-$, $1^-$, $2^-$, $3^-$, or $4^-$.\nBut the $D$ meson has quantum numbers $1^-$, so this matches.\n\nImportantly, this decay can also happen in different partial waves.\nNo—wait, it cannot.\nThis decay doesn't have to conserve parity for this transition.\nBoth $0^-$ and $0^+$ transitions are possible because it's a weak decay.\nFrom this, you get $S$, but it's not the only answer.\nAnother possibility is $1^+$.\nWith two units of orbital angular momentum, you can get $1^+$, $2^+$.\n\n---\n\nI would like to motivate the next subject: how the amplitude $A(s)$ behaves near particle thresholds.\nFor $A(s) = M_1 + M_2$, we are still discussing general properties.\n\nLet’s look at the partial wave expansion for a particle with spin $j$ and helicity $\\lambda$ decaying into two scalar particles.\nWe can rewrite the decay using Wigner rotations, matching the alignment of the final states.\nThe initial state has spin projection $\\lambda$ along the $z$-axis, and the Wigner $d$-function depends on the helicity difference of the final particles.\n\nIn the rest frame, the spin projection is $\\lambda$, and the decay angle is $\\theta$.\nLet’s examine $\\lambda = 0$ and the spherical harmonics.\n\nFor $l = 1$, it’s $\\cos \\theta$.\nFor $l = 2$, it’s $\\frac{3}{2} \\cos^2 \\theta - \\frac{1}{2}$.\nAnd the third one is $\\frac{3}{2} \\cos^2 \\theta - \\frac{1}{2} - 1$, right?\nNo, it's just $\\cos \\theta$.\nFor $2 \\rightarrow 2$, it’s straightforward.\n\n---\n\n::: callout-note\nPartial wave expansion for spin $j$ and helicity $\\lambda$:\n$$\nA(s) \\propto \\sum_j (2j + 1) d^j_{\\lambda,0}(\\theta) \\mathcal{A}_j(s)\n$$\nwhere $d^j_{\\lambda,0}(\\theta)$ is the Wigner $d$-function.\n:::\n---\n\nThe spherical harmonics for $\\lambda = 0$ are:\n\n- $Y_1^0(\\theta) \\propto \\cos\\theta$\n- $Y_2^0(\\theta) \\propto \\frac{3}{2}\\cos^2\\theta - \\frac{1}{2}$\n\n---\n\nThe breakup momentum $P$ in relativistic scattering is given by:\n$$\n\\rho \\propto P = \\frac{\\sqrt{(s - (M_1 + M_2)^2)(s - (M_1 - M_2)^2)}}{2\\sqrt{s}}\n$$\n\n### Kinematic Singularities and Angular Momentum Compensation in Scattering Amplitudes\n\n\nEarlier we discussed that there are **invariant variables** described by Mandelstam variables: $S$ and $T$. It is often convenient to express the cosine of the scattering angle in terms of these variables. One can use either the basis of the scattering angle and the energy $\\sqrt{S}$, or work directly with Mandelstam variables, as they are related. Thus, $\\cos \\theta$ can be expressed in terms of $T$ and $S$.\n\n::: callout-note\nThe relation for cosine of the scattering angle is:\n$$\\cos \\theta = f(S, T)$$\nwhere $f(S, T)$ is a polynomial in $T$ and $S$.\n:::\nFor this decay process, we don't have $T$. But for the point I would like to make, let's imagine that this is produced by an external reference—a two-particle scattering that gives us an extra vector to calculate $T$. If $\\cos \\theta$ is expressed in terms of $S$ and $T$, one finds that it is essentially a polynomial: a first-order polynomial in $T$ and a second-order in $S$, divided by the **Chew-Mandelstam functions**, which are the breakup momentum of the particles in the $S$-channel.\n\n---\n\nFor the **S-wave**, there is a constant factor. For the **P-wave**, the breakup momentum appears in the first power in the denominator. For the **D-wave**, it appears in the second power. To compensate for the $p^J$ dependence in the denominator from angular momentum, this factor must appear in the numerator of the partial wave. This ensures the total amplitude is free of kinematic singularities at the threshold. The amplitude does not fully account for the threshold behavior $p^{2L}$, so this compensation is necessary.\n\n::: callout-important\nBreakup momentum dependence for partial waves:\n\n- **S-wave ($L = 0$)**: No explicit $p$ dependence\n- **P-wave ($L = 1$)**: $\\frac{1}{p}$\n- **D-wave ($L = 2$)**: $\\frac{1}{p^2}$\n:::\n---\n\nThis is often seen in phenomenological constructions. When fitting data, the recipe includes $p^L$ in the partial wave (for $L$-wave) because it compensates for the angular momentum dependence, which scales as $1/p^L$. This is important. For example, in the parameterization of the $\\rho$ meson decaying to $\\pi\\pi$, the $p^2$ factor appears twice: once in the numerator to compensate for angular dependence, and once in the denominator in the width parameter, because the width sums over the $\\pi\\pi$ scattering phase space.\n\nThis leads to a parameterization where, at every vertex, there is a $p^1$. The $p^{2L}$ arises from vertices due to the $p^2$ factor, and another from phase space. For the $\\rho$ meson transition, this results in $p^3$ appearing in the denominator of the width parameter.\n\n::: callout-note\nRho meson width parameterization (P-wave decay, $J = 1$):\n$$\\Gamma_\\rho \\sim p^3$$\n:::\n---\n\nAnother example is the $D$ meson decay, where $p^L$ also appears. The $D^* \\to D\\pi$ decay is in P-wave, so there is always a momentum factor. Often, when constructing amplitudes, the kinematic-singularity-free amplitude $\\hat{A}$ is introduced, defined as $\\hat{A} = A \\cdot (2p)^J$ for $L$-wave. This replacement introduces the factor $(2p)^{2J}$ on the right side.\n\n::: callout-note\nKinematic-singularity-free amplitude:\n$$\\hat{A} = A \\cdot (2p)^J \\quad \\text{(for L-wave)}$$\n:::\n---\n\nI need to clarify the difference between resonance production and particle scattering. Typically, $A$ denotes the production amplitude, while $T$ denotes the scattering amplitude. The kinematic-free amplitude reduction ensures $T_J$ is free of kinematic singularities. The key difference is that $T$ involves the same initial and final states (e.g., $\\pi\\pi \\to \\pi\\pi$), while $A$ involves different states (e.g., $X \\to \\pi\\pi$).\n\nFor $T_J$, the factor is $(2p)^{2J}$. The amplitude here refers to scattering, not production. In the production amplitude, $p$ and $q$ are distinct, but for identical initial and final states, they are the same, leading to $p^{2J}$. The denominator's parameterization describes how particles scatter, which is why the factor $(2J + 1)$ appears.\n\n::: callout-important\nPartial wave expansion:\n\n- **Scattering ($\\pi\\pi \\to \\pi\\pi$)**: $T_J \\sim (2p)^{2J}$\n- **Production ($X \\to \\pi\\pi$)**: $A_J \\sim (2p)^J$\n:::\n### Scattering Phase Shift and Amplitude Near Threshold\n\n\n\nLet’s think how to derive this in the quickest way.\n\nIt is straightforward to see that the **phase shift** $\\delta$ near threshold behaves as:\n\n$$\n\\delta \\propto p^{2L + 1}\n$$\n\nTransforming this to $\\sqrt{s}$, we get:\n\n$$\n\\delta \\propto (\\sqrt{s} - (m_1 + m_2))^{2L + 1}\n$$\n\n---\n\n\nFor **S-wave scattering**, the amplitude is constant at the threshold, as is the scattering amplitude. We can write this as:\n\n$$\nA = \\frac{1}{R - i \\rho}\n$$\n\nFor the S-wave at threshold, $\\rho$ vanishes because $\\rho$ has the momentum in the first power, leaving only the regular function $R$.\n\nThe value of $R$ at the threshold is called the **scattering length**. Let’s denote it as $\\alpha$ (or $a$).\n\n::: callout-note\n**Scattering Length Approximation**:\nReplace the unknown $R$ function by a constant. This is valid for all amplitudes near the threshold, where $R$ behaves as a constant.\n:::\n---\n\n\nFor some amplitudes, this approximation holds even farther from the threshold, especially if no other singularities influence the amplitude. There are two interesting cases:\n\n- **$R > 0$**\n- **$R < 0$**\n\nThese lead to distinct phenomena.\n\n---\n\n\nAs a function of $s$, $\\rho$ starts at the threshold and grows like:\n\n$$\n\\rho \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{s - (m_1 + m_2)^2}\n$$\n\nNear threshold, it behaves as $\\sqrt{s}$.\n\nBelow the threshold, $\\rho$ becomes imaginary. For $s < (m_1 + m_2)^2$:\n\n$$\n\\rho = i \\sqrt{(m_1 + m_2)^2 - s}\n$$\n\nSo $-i\\rho$ has a negative imaginary part.\n\n---\n\n\n- If $1/a$ is **negative and small**, there is a zero in the denominator.\n- If $a$ is **positive**, there is no pole in the physical region. The function continues downward, with $\\rho$ negative.\n\nThe square root is a **two-valued function**, creating a branch point and a cut. For every point, the square root can be evaluated with:\n\n- **Plus sign** (on the first sheet)\n- **Minus sign** (on the second sheet)\n\nFor $a > 0$, there is still a pole, but it is hidden—only visible if you go under the cut. This is the **virtual state**: a pole below the threshold on the second Riemann sheet.\n\n---\n\n::: callout-important\n**Key Takeaway**:\nThe scattering length approximation simplifies the amplitude near threshold, but the behavior of $\\rho$ and the pole conditions reveal deeper structures like virtual states.\n:::\n### Scattering Length, Bound States, and Effective Field Theory in Threshold Scattering\n\n\nThe **scattering length** is an important quantity that is measured from any scattering experiment in nuclear physics.\nThis is one of the **good observables** that people use.\nThis quantity characterizes the strength of the matrix element at the threshold.\n\n::: callout-note\nNear threshold, the transition matrix element simplifies to:\n$$ T \\approx A $$\nwhere $T$ is the transition matrix and $A$ is the scattering length.\n:::\nAs you see, you just evaluate $T$ at the threshold, this vanishes and $T$ is literally equal to $A$.\nBut if the validity of the scattering length approximation extends a little further, you find that for large values of $A$, you can get a bound state near the threshold.\n\n---\n\nThis bound state is the example of the **deuteron**.\nThe deuteron, which is formed by the scattering of a proton and neutron, is a bound state of the proton and neutron.\nIt is a good example where the scattering length approximation works.\n\nWhen you scatter a proton and neutron near threshold, you find that $A$ is negative, which corresponds to the neutron being below the threshold.\nAlternatively, due to the presence of the neutron below threshold, when a proton and neutron scatter, they feel the presence of the neutron and have a negative scattering length.\n\nThe scattering length is measured in units of **Fermi**.\nFor the deuteron, it is approximately $-5.4$ to $-5.5$ Fermi.\n\n---\n\nWe will now consider different approaches to quantum physics.\nOne of them, **effective field theory at low energy**, deals with calculating a low momentum expansion.\nThis approach gives parameters like the scattering length approximation or the next term in the expansion, called the **effective range**.\n\n::: callout-note\nThe **effective range expansion** for S-wave scattering is:\n$$ k \\cot \\delta_0 \\approx -\\frac{1}{A} + \\frac{1}{2} r_0 k^2 + \\mathcal{O}(k^4) $$\nwhere:\n\n- $k$ is the momentum,\n- $\\delta_0$ is the S-wave phase shift,\n- $A$ is the scattering length,\n- $r_0$ is the effective range.\n:::\nFor neutron scattering, measurements are difficult because neutrons are non-magnetic.\nProton scattering is much easier to calculate.\n\nIn the notes, I have a value, but the conventions are slightly different.\nThe units must be corrected—we want something in Fermi.\nWhat I have here is the mass of the pion in the numerator and the low-energy constant $F_\\pi$ in GeV.\nThey cancel each other, so this is not in our usual conventions.\n\n---\n\nFor pion s-wave scattering, we can use **effective field theory** to compute scattering near threshold.\nThe result depends on a single constant, $F_\\pi$, which is fixed experimentally.\nThis low-energy theory uses **spontaneous symmetry breaking**, similar to the Higgs mechanism.\nLike all effective field theories, it builds the most general Lagrangian and fixes all constants.\n\nAt the lowest order, the amplitude is constant.\nThis theory does not account for unitarity, so it does not include an imaginary part.\nThe constant is equal to the scattering length in this sector.\nEffective field theory works well near threshold, where it provides constraints for fitting experimental data.\n\n---\n\n**Unitarity** tells us how the amplitude behaves generally, but not the exact functional form.\nConstraints on these functions come from other methods, such as effective field theory.\n\n::: callout-note\nThe unitarity condition for partial wave amplitudes is:\n$$ \\text{Im}\\, f_l(k) = k |f_l(k)|^2 $$\nwhich must be satisfied for elastic scattering.\n:::\nI planned to cover more today, including **chiral perturbation theory**, but we are out of time.\n\n---\n\nWe discussed **kinematic singularities**, which arise because the full amplitude must be free of them.\nAngular factors introduce $1/P^j$ due to cosine or sine terms.\nThe same factor appears in partial wave amplitudes and modifies unitarity.\n\nWe introduced $\\hat{A}$ and $\\hat{T}$, which are kinematic singularity-free functions.\nFor mean parity equations, an extra factor impacts how we construct the amplitude.\n\n---\n\nThe first term in the expansion is related to the partial wave.\nFor the S-wave, it is simply $P$, and the prefactor is $1/A$.\nThe next term is $r P^2 / 2$, where $r$ is the effective range.\nThe function $R$ is regular, and $P^2$ appears because lower powers would introduce a branch point.\n\n---\n\nWe examined the **analytic structure** of the scattering length approximation.\nA negative scattering length introduces a pole, while a large positive value leads to a virtual state.\n\n::: callout-note\nThe pole position for a bound state near threshold is:\n$$ E_{\\text{pole}} \\approx -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu A^2} $$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the reduced mass and $A$ is the scattering length (negative for a bound state).\n:::\nThe closer the pole is to the threshold, the larger the amplitude near threshold.\nA large scattering length suggests a nearby pole—either a virtual state (positive) or a bound state (negative).\n\n---\n\nFor **proton-neutron scattering**, the interaction strength is high due to the deuteron.\nHowever, scattering cannot form a deuteron because energy conservation prevents it.\nThe amplitude above threshold reflects the pole below threshold.\n\nIf we tune the scattering length from a small negative value, the pole moves toward threshold.\nAt $A = -\\infty$, the pole reaches threshold, then jumps to $+\\infty$ and moves away.\n\nAn example of a virtual state is **neutron-neutron scattering**.\nThere is no bound state, but the amplitude is large at threshold due to a virtual state.\n\n---\n\nThat concludes today’s discussion.\nNext time, we will cover methods for sophisticated matrix element calculations, including **lattice QCD**.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","title-prefix":"Hadron
