1 : The diagram depicted is a chalk-drawn timeline on a green chalkboard, outlining a sequence of events in theoretical physics or cosmology, specifically concerning the Big Bang and related phases. The horizontal line labeled with the letter 't' represents time, extending from an initial point on the left, marked with an explosion sign (simplified to represent the Big Bang), to the right where specific times are noted, such as 0.0003 s and 400000 y, ending with a sketch that resembles an atom. Along the timeline, there are various annotations at specific points, such as "10^-12", "10^-6", "10^-5", "1 s", each marking significant epochs with corresponding physical phenomena, depicted with small sketches and symbols such as protons (P), neutrons (n), and electrons (e), indicating particle characteristics and interactions during those periods. Additional notes like "BBN", "400000y", "14 by", and labels like "radiation supermatter through matter" provide context about cosmic and atomic evolution stages, suggesting that the diagram serves educational purposes in explaining cosmic timelines and elemental genesis after the creation of the universe.

2 : The diagram, labeled "Matter structure," depicts a simplistic model of an atom or a similar subatomic structure on a chalkboard. Central to the image is a cluster of circles representing particles (like protons and neutrons) packed closely together in what appears to be the nucleus of the atom, enveloped by four elliptical orbits suggesting the paths of electrons around the nucleus. The dimensions given include "6 fm" presumably indicating the diameter of the nucleus, and "100 pm" likely indicating the overall diameter of the atom including its electron orbits, with these measurements linked by straight lines drawn from the text to the specific features on the diagram.

3 : The diagram depicts a simple representation of the solar system focused primarily on the Earth and the Sun. It includes a large circle representing the Sun, labeled with "SS" at its center, and an icon representing the Sun's rays emanating outward. There is also a smaller circle outside the Sun, labeled "Earth," signifying the Earth's orbit; the annotation "scaled by 150 times (smaller)" is written, indicating the scale used for the diagram relative to actual celestial sizes.

4 : The diagram is a handwritten representation of components of the Standard Model of particle physics on a chalkboard. At the top, the equation "SM = EW ⊗ QCD" is written, where "SM" stands for Standard Model, "EW" for Electroweak interaction, "QCD" for Quantum Chromodynamics, and the ⊗ symbol denotes a tensor product. Below this, branching from the EW ⊗ QCD, the diagram shows a breakdown into two paths: one path leads to "(EM ⊗ Weak ⊗ Higgs)" which is further detailed with boxed symbols for "H," "W," "Z," "γ," and arrows pointing to labels "Weak," "EM," and "EW"; the other path lists particles 'e-, mu+, tau-', and quarks 'u, d, s, t, b, c', with notation indicating the electromagnetic (EM) and Electroweak (EW) interactions, and the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) interaction, represented with a gluon symbol drawn in a small box to the right.

5 : The diagram illustrates a pendulum system on a vertical chalkboard with mathematical formulas surrounding it. At the top, a pivot point labeled with an 'x' marks the origin from which a pendulum consisting of a rod and a bob (mass m) extends downward; the rod is depicted at an angle labeled \(\theta\) from the vertical, and the length of the rod from the pivot to the bob is denoted as \(l\). Additional details include annotations for the velocity component \(2l\dot{\theta} \cdot \sin(\theta)\), matching the kinetic energy part of the formula written, and the potential energy shown as \(U = -mgl \cos(\theta)\), with a collective mechanics equation \(L = T - U\) where \(L\) represents the Lagrangian, \(T\) is the total kinetic energy and \(U\) is the potential energy.

6 : The diagram consists of a chalkboard background with two intersecting lines, each bearing labels and arrows indicating specific functions. One line is roughly horizontal and has a wavy pattern resembling a sinusoidal wave; it is labeled with a lowercase "f" at its starting point on the left and an arrow pointing towards the right end. The other line is straight and intersects the first at a sharp angle, starting from below the first line and moving upwards past the intersection point; it is labeled with a lowercase "g" at the bottom and an arrow at the top indicating its direction vertically upward past the intersection where both lines meet at a small circle labeled "y".

7 : The diagram illustrates a scientific concept on a green chalkboard focusing on the confinement of particles. To the left, large and smaller overlapping circles are drawn, labeled "Meson" and "Baryon," and containing combinations of "quark" symbols, with arrows labeled "strong interaction inside" pointing between quarks within the meson and additional unlinked quarks sketched beside. Moving towards the right, there are series of annotations and drawings detailing types of interactions, denoted by curved arrows and multiple paired symbols, demonstrating transitions and configurations among various particle types, including an important label, "Confinement," at the top which appears to govern the overall interaction diagram, suggesting a flow of process or concept explanation across the board.

8 : The diagram features a coordinate system drawn on a chalkboard, likely depicting some physical or conceptual relationships. The vertical axis is labeled "Interaction 'disk'" at the top and has notations like "conventional hadrons" along its length. The horizontal axis spans a range labeled from "1 GeV" to "10 GeV," suggesting a scale possibly related to energy or mass units used in physics, especially in particle physics topics like QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics). Across this axis and slightly rightward, terms such as "asymptotic freedom" indicate a concept where interactions between particles become weaker at higher energy scales. Additionally, the chalkboard context, handwriting style, and characteristic green background indicate an academic or research environment.

9 : The diagram depicted on the green chalkboard includes hand-drawn representations likely related to particle physics or advanced theoretical physics concepts, set alongside handwritten annotations and equations. The drawings mainly consist of three looped diagrams resembling particle interaction models, characterized by lines and loops with arrows at their ends; these diagrams are widely used in physics to represent processes such as particle collisions or interactions. Annotations in white chalk suggest topics like "particles are color neutral" and include numerous scientific symbols and acronyms, indicative of the diagrams explaining properties such as gauge theory or the behavior of force carriers in quantum fields.

10 : The diagram is drawn on a green chalkboard and features a curving line with a closed loop on its left side, suggesting a flow or cycle. Just above this loop, there’s a label "Q" pointing to the loop with an arrow, and another term "Lepton" with an arrow pointing downwards toward the right side of the line. Below the curved line, near the right end, the word "fermion" is written, appearing to label the object or concept represented by the line.
