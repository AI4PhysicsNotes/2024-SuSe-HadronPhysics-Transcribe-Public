### Figure 1

Evolution of matter from the Big Bang (left) to the present (flag). The diagram illustrates transitions from quarkâ€“gluon plasma to hadrons (baryons and mesons), then nuclei formation, and finally the decoupling of radiation from matter.

### Figure 2

This diagram shows the electronic energy levels (1s, 2s, 2p) of an oxygen atom, with energy increasing upward. It illustrates how electrons occupy quantized orbitals around the nucleus, with 1s being the lowest energy level and 2p the highest among those shown.

### Figure 3

Structure of an oxygen atom with compact nucleus and surrounding electron cloud. The sketch highlights the separation of scales and shows that most of the atomic volume is empty space, with the dense nucleus occupying only a tiny fraction.

### Figure 4

An example of mechanical model described by Lagrangian mechanics: a pendulum of mass m with a support of the same mass moving horizontally. The sketch illustrates degrees of freedom and serves as motivation for introducing Lagrangian equations, preparing for its role in the Standard Model formulation.

### Figure 5

Feynman diagram representing an interaction term in the Lagrangian: two fermion fields coupled to the electromagnetic current with vertex strength g. The diagram directly corresponds to the interaction term of the Lagrangian.

### Figure 6

Diagrams of gluon self-interactions arising from the gauge part of the Lagrangian. These illustrate the non-Abelian nature of QCD and provide the basis for color confinement.

### Figure 7

Running of the strong coupling $\alpha_s(Q)$ with momentum transfer $Q$. At high $Q$, the coupling decreases, showing asymptotic freedom; at low $Q \lesssim 1 GeV$, the coupling grows large, marking the confinement region.
